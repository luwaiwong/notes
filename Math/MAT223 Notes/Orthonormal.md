An **Orthonormal Set** $A$, is a set where each vector is a [Unit Vector](../MAT235%20Notes/Unit%20Vector.md), and [Orthogonal](Orthogonal.md) to each other .

A set of nonzero vectors $v_{1},...,v_{k}\in V$ is called **Orthonormal** if $\langle v_{i},v_{j}\rangle = 0$ for $i\neq j$ and in addition, $\langle v_{i}, v_{i}\rangle = 1$, for  all $i$.

>**Orthonormal Bases** are [Base](Base.md)s consisting of **Unit Vectors** **Orthogonal** to one another
