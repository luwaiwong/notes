#### Mon
- Obvious, no notes

Homework
- Expand only the $\prod$ notation in $\sum^{2}_{j=0}\left( \prod_{k=0}^{2}a_{j,k} \right)$
- Expand $\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\left( \prod_{k=0}^{n-1} a_{j,k} \right)$ using $\dots$ notation, since you don't know the specific number of terms
- Explore 

#### Wed
1. f $\exists c \in \{ \text{csc108}, \text{csc165}, \text{csc148} \}, c \text{ is fun}$, identify and determine whether it's true or fale

2. For each of the following  
		$\forall n\in \{ n'\in \mathbb{N}: n'<10  \ \land \ n' \text{ is prime} \}, n \text{ is odd}$  
		$\exists z \in \mathbb{Z}, z^{2}<z$  
		$\forall x\in \{ 1,6,5 \}, (\exists y\in \{ 1, 0, 8 \}, y-x \text{ is even})$  
	Identify & determine which are true and which are false:
	
3. Use quantification to express "row $j$ has a zero" in that, using a body $a_{j,k}=0$  
	Use result to express when $E_{\Sigma \Pi}$ is false, express condition for $E_{\Sigma \Pi}$ to be true, and condition for it to be false, give corresponding expansions

4. Use the terminology of counter examples and witnesses to phrase why the first four examples on the first page are true or false, when applicable
