A [Set](Set.md) can have an **Ordering**, defined by a [Relation](Relation.md) which defines the relationships between elements of the set

> Like A [Relation](Relation.md), but instead of being between two different sets, is between a set and itself, defining relationships between the elements of the set instead of between the elements of two sets

>An [Ordering](.md) of a set can be visualized as a set of nodes, with arrows connected to one another

## Types of Orderings

A  [Total Ordering](Total%20Ordering.md) is when all elements have a relationship to all other elements

[Well Ordering](Well%20Ordering.md) is all nodes are connected to all other nodes, in a order

>Note in the well ordering example, how each node connects to every node, and only points downwards from where it starts
