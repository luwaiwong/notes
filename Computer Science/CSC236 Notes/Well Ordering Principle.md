The **Well Ordering Principle** states that every [Non Empty](Non%20Empty.md) [Set](Set.md) of [Natural Numbers](Natural%20Numbers) $\mathbb{N}$ has a *smallest* element

> This principle can be proved using [Induction](Induction.md)  
> Induction and Well Ordering have a close relationship, in that they are equivalent  
> 	Although so far we are only shown that induction implies well ordering, not the other way around yet  
> 	(We can prove that the well ordering principle is true, with induction)  
> I'm not sure that this all matters, just understand relations, and well ordering in relation to nodes
