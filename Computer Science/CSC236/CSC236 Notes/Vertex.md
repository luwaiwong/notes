A **Vertex** is a node in a [Graph](Graph.md)

It can be connected to other [Vertices](.md) through [Edges](Edge.md)

---

## Properties

The [Degree](Degree.md) of a [Vertex](.md) is the *number of neighbors* it has, or the amount of edges it has connecting it to other vertices
 
 A [Leaf](Leaf.md) is a [Vertex](.md) with degree 1 in a tree
