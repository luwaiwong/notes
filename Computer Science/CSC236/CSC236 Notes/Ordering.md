A [[Set]] can have an **Ordering**, defined by a [[Relation]] which defines the relationships between elements of the set

> Like A [[Relation]], but instead of being between two different sets, is between a set and itself, defining relationships between the elements of the set instead of between the elements of two sets

>An [[Ordering]] of a set can be visualized as a set of nodes, with arrows connected to one another

## Types of Orderings

A  [[Total Ordering]] is when all elements have a relationship to all other elements

[[Well Ordering]] is all nodes are connected to all other nodes, in a order

>Note in the well ordering example, how each node connects to every node, and only points downwards from where it starts
