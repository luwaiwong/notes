A **Transitive** [Relation](Relation.md) is one in which you can "remove the middleman" in a chain of relations
	If $xRy$ and $yRz$, then $xRz$

A **Transitive** [Action](../../../Mathematics/MAT301%20Notes/Action.md) is one where there is only one [Orbit](../../../Mathematics/MAT301%20Notes/Orbit.md), for any $x,y$ there is some $g$ such that $g \ .x=y$

**Properties of Transitive Actions
- "[Freeness](../../../Mathematics/MAT301%20Notes/Free.md)" and "transitivity" can be seen as opposing forces
- An action which is both free and transitive is called *regular*
