A **Transitive** [[Relation]] is one in which you can "remove the middleman" in a chain of relations
	If $xRy$ and $yRz$, then $xRz$

A **Transitive** [[Action]] is one where there is only one [[Orbit]], for any $x,y$ there is some $g$ such that $g \ .x=y$

**Properties of Transitive Actions
- "[[Free|Freeness]]" and "transitivity" can be seen as opposing forces
- An action which is both free and transitive is called *regular*
