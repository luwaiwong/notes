a **Well Ordering** is when all elements of a [Set](../../../Mathematics/MAT223%20Notes/Set.md), following a certain [Relation](Relation.md), have a [Relationship](Relationship.md) to all other elements, in a specific order, where every non-empty subset has a *least element*

>A **Well Ordering** Is a [Total Ordering](Total%20Ordering.md) where very non-empty subset has a *least element*
	This least element is not directed to any other element
