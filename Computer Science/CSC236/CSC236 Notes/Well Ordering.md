a **Well Ordering** is when all elements of a [[Set]], following a certain [[Relation]], have a [[Relationship]] to all other elements, in a specific order, where every non-empty subset has a *least element*

>A **Well Ordering** Is a [[Total Ordering]] where very non-empty subset has a *least element*
	This least element is not directed to any other element

>Note in the well ordering example, how each node connects to every node, and only points downwards from where it starts
