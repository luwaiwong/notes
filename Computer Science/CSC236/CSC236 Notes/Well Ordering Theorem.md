The **Well Ordering Theorem** (also called **Zermelo's Theorem**) states that every [[Non Empty]] [[Set]] of [[Natural Numbers]] has a relation < on $S$ which is a [[Well Ordering]]

> This states that the natural numbers are [[Well Ordering]]
> Also mentioned in lectures is that combined with [[Zorn's Lemma]] results in the [[Axiom of Choice]] (No idea what this means)
