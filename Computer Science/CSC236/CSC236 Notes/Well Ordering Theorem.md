The **Well Ordering Theorem** (also called **Zermelo's Theorem**) states that every [Non Empty](Non%20Empty.md) [Set](../../../Mathematics/MAT223%20Notes/Set.md) of [Natural Numbers](Natural%20Numbers) has a relation < on $S$ which is a [Well Ordering](Well%20Ordering.md)

> This states that the natural numbers are [Well Ordering](Well%20Ordering.md)  
> Also mentioned in lectures is that combined with [Zorn's Lemma](Zorn's%20Lemma) results in the [Axiom of Choice](Axiom%20of%20Choice) (No idea what this means)
