[[Structural Induction]] is a proving technique similar to [[Induction]] (Hence the name)

Structural Induction is the technique of using the [[Recursively Defined Set|Recursive Definition of a Set]] to prove a property for all elements of the set
1. Prove that the base case of the recursive definition follows the property
2. **Inductive Hypothesis**, show that given the base case being true, recursively defined elements also maintain the property
