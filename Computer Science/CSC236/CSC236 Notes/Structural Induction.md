[Structural Induction](.md) is a proving technique similar to [Induction](Induction.md) (Hence the name)

Structural Induction is the technique of using the [Recursive Definition of a Set](Recursively%20Defined%20Set.md) to prove a property for all elements of the set
1. Prove that the base case of the recursive definition follows the property
2. **Inductive Hypothesis**, show that given the base case being true, recursively defined elements also maintain the property
