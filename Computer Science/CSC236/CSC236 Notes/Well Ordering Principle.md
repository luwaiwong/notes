The **Well Ordering Principle** states that every [[Non Empty]] [[Set]] of [[Natural Numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$ has a *smallest* element

> This principle can be proved using [[Induction]]
> Induction and Well Ordering have a close relationship, in that they are equivalent 
> 	Although so far we are only shown that induction implies well ordering, not the other way around yet
> 	(We can prove that the well ordering principle is true, with induction)
> I'm not sure that this all matters, just understand relations, and well ordering in relation to nodes
