## Definition

A [Cycle](.md) in a [Permutation](../../../Statistics/STA237%20Notes/Permutation.md), is a set of elements which *loops back on itself* as the permutation is applied

A  $k$-*cycle* (with $k\geq 2$), denoted $(a_{1} \ a_{2} \ ... \ a_{k})$, is a [Permutation](../../../Statistics/STA237%20Notes/Permutation.md) which
- *Moves* $a_{i}$ to $a_{i+1}$ for $1\leq i\leq k$, 
- *Moves* $a_{k}$ to $a_1$, and
- *Fixes* everything else

We can also define the action and accompanying [Orbit](../../../Mathematics/MAT301%20Notes/Orbit.md) below, and use it to help formally define a cycle
	Let $X$ be a set and let $\sigma\in S_{X}$. Define $x\sim y$ [IFF](IFF) $\sigma^{k}(x)=y$ for some integer $k$. Then $\sigma$ is an [Equivalence Relation](../../../Mathematics/MAT301%20Notes/Equivalence%20Relation.md)
Properties
- This relation relates two elements if they are in the same *cycle
- The orbit of a particular $x\in X$ under this action is denoted $\langle \sigma\rangle x$
	- Called, the *orbit of $x$ under $\sigma$* 
	- The set of orbits *the orbits of $\sigma$*
	- $\langle \sigma\rangle x=\{\sigma^{k}(x):k\in \mathbb{Z}\}$

Then, A **Cycle** is a *permutation* with just one nontrivial orbit. If that orbit has size $k$, the cycle is called a $k$-*cycle* and $k$ is called the *length

The [Cycle Type](../../../Mathematics/MAT301%20Notes/Cycle%20Type.md) of a [Permutation](../../../Statistics/STA237%20Notes/Permutation.md) is a list of the number of cycles of every possible length, for that permutation
Formally, Let $\sigma\in S_{X}$ for each $k=1,2,\dots,\infty$ let $c_{k}$ be the number of orbits of size $k$. The *Cycle Type* of $\sigma$ is the ordered list of the $c_{k}$'s
Properties
- When $X$ is finite of order $n$, then so is every orbit, and $\sum\limits_{k\geq 1}kc_{k}=n$

> Example of Cycle Type
> 	The cycle type of $\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 2 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$ is $(0,1,1,0,0)$
> 	The cycle type of $\uptau=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ 4 & 7 & 1 & 3 & 8 & 6 & 2 & 5 \end{pmatrix}$ is $(1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0)$

### Properties of Cycles
- $\sigma$ is a *transposition* [IFF](IFF) $\sigma$ is a 2-cycle
- The *inverse* of a cycle can be obtained by writing it backwards such that $(a \ b \ c \ d \ e)^{-1}=(e\ d \ c\ b\ a)=(a\ e\ d\ c\ b)$
	- The *inverse* of a cycle is **always** a cycle
	- The composition of any cycle with its inverse is the *identity map*, which is not a cycle
- The product of cycles is not necessarily a cycle
- An *infinite cycle* is a permutation denoted $(... \ a_{-1} \ a_{0} \ a_{1} \ a_{2}\ ...)$
	- Also called $\infty$-cycles, or *chains* because they aren't really "cycles" in the literal sense
- Two permutations are *disjoint* if they do not move any of the same elements. Formally, $\sigma$ and $\uptau$ are *disjoint* if for all $x$ in $X$, $\sigma(x)\neq x$ implies $\uptau (x)=x$
	- Disjoint permutations commute, or $\sigma\uptau = \uptau \sigma$ for disjoint cycles $\sigma$ and $\uptau$
- Any $k$-cycle $(a_{1} \ \dots \ a_{k})$ can be written as a product of *transpositions* 
	- $(a_{1} \ \dots \ a_{k})=(a_{1} \ a_{2})\dots(a_{k-1} \ a_{k})$
	- Since any permutation in $n$ can be written as a product of transpositions, $S_{n}$ is generated by the transpositions in $S_{n}$
		- $S_{n}$ is generated by the transpositions $(1 \ 2),(2 \ 3), \dots, (n-1 \ n)$
		- $S_{n}$ is also generated by $\sigma=(1\ 2 \ \dots \ n)$ and $\uptau= (1\ 2)$


### Order of a Permutation
- If $\sigma$ and $\uptau$ are disjoint permutations of finite order, then $o(\sigma\uptau)=lcm(o(\sigma),o(\uptau))$ 
- If $\sigma$ has *cycle type* $(c_{1},c_{2},\dots ;c_\infty)$, and $c_{\infty}=0$ and $c_{k}=0$ for all but finitely many $k$, then $o(\sigma)=lcm(k:c_{k}>0)$

### Cycle Decomposition Theorem

[Cycle Decomposition Theorem](Cycle%20Decomposition%20Theorem) says that every permutation can be written as a product of *disjoint cycles*, and each decomposition is *unique*

> Examples of breaking up permutations in terms of cycles
> 	Take the permutation $\sigma = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 2 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3\end{pmatrix}$
> 		This permutation is obviously *not* a cycle, but it is a product of the cycles
> 			$(1\ 2)$ and $(3\ 4\ 5)$ 
> 		Such that $\sigma=(1 \ 2)(3\ 4\ 5)=(3\ 4\ 5)(1\ 2)$
> 	Or take $\uptau=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ 4 & 7 & 1 & 3 & 8 & 6 & 2 & 5 \end{pmatrix}$
> 		$\uptau=(1 \ 4\ 3)(2\ 7)(5\ 8)$ 
> 	Note that we can technically break a permutation into cycles in multiple different ways, the important factor here is we are looking for *disjoint cycles*
> 		Take for example $(1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5)=(1\ 2)(2\ 3)(3\ 4)(4\ 5)=(1\ 4\ 5)(1\ 2\ 3)$

Formally, it says:
Let $X$ be a set and let $\sigma\in S_{X}$. Then there exists pairwise-disjoint cycles $\sigma_{i}\in S_{X}$ such that 
$$\sigma=\prod_{i}\sigma_{i}$$
Moreover, this decomposition into cycles is unique up to reordering. That is, if $\uptau_{j}\in S_{X}$ are any other pairwise-disjoint cycles whose product is $\sigma$, then there exists a bijection $\varphi$ such that $\uptau_{j}=\sigma_{\varphi(j)}$ for all $j$

# Graph Theory
A **Cycle** is a $u,u$-[Path](Path.md), or one which starts, and ends on the same [Vertex](Vertex.md)
