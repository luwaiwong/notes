In the first lecture, we jumped right into the topic of design. Part of the intention of this was to get you thinking about what kind of questions one should be asking when thinking about software design.

Your first design "question" for this term is to come up with three questions which you have about any of the topics introduced during the first lecture of the term. If you missed it, you can refer back to the materials in [Lectures for Week 0](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/314288/pages/lectures-for-week-0?wrap=1 "Lectures for Week 0").
[[01-Introduction-clean.pdf]]

Your questions will be read and we'll pick out any common questions or particularly interesting ones to share with the class.

Grading Scheme:

This is worth 1% of your course grade. You will earn full credit if you submit three questions which demonstrate some level of depth to them. For example, something like: "1. What is design? 2. What is clean architecture 3. What is Java?" would not earn you credit, as they were clearly written without any real thought having been put into them. You should aim to spend at least fifteen minutes to formulate these questions, but we don't want you to feel the need to spend much more than that unless you decide to discuss question ideas with others (see below).

1. How does Java differ from Python, what are the differences in syntax, different design paradigms used, etc.?
2. How do developers collaborate without getting in each others way, and how do you organize the development of a project as a project manager?
3. What are the most popular design strategies, frameworks, used to ensure clean architecture?
