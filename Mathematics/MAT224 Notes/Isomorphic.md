In [[Linear Algebra]], Two [[Vector Space|Vector Spaces]] are $V$ and $W$ are *Isomorphic*, if there exists a [[Linear Transformation|Linear Transformation]] $T:V\rightarrow W$ that is an [[Isomorphism]]
- If two vector spaces have the same [[Dimension]], they are isomorphic

>Isomorphisms of vector spaces are a way to describe the way some vector spaces are really "the same", even though the elements may be written in different ways 

In [[Group Theory]], Two [[Group|Groups]] $(G,*), (H,\circ)$ are *isomorphic* if there exists a [[Bijective|Bijection]] $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ such that for all $a,b\in G$, $\phi(a*b)=\phi(a)\circ \phi(b)$
Also:
- $\phi(e_G)=e_H$ 
- $\phi(g^{-1})=\phi(g)^{-1}$
Denoted $G\cong H$ if $G$ and $H$ are [[Isomorphism|Isomorphisms]]

The [[Bijective|Bijection]] $\phi$ is called an [[Isomorphism]]

# Group Theory
Two [[Group|Groups]] $(G,*), (H,\circ)$ are *isomorphic* if there exists a [[Bijective|Bijection]] $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ such that for all $a,b\in G$, $\phi(a*b)=\phi(a)\circ \phi(b)$
Also:
- $\phi(e_G)=e_H$ 
- $\phi(g^{-1})=\phi(g)^{-1}$

## Notation
Denoted $G\cong H$ if $G$ and $H$ are *isomorphic*
We call the [[Bijective|Bijection]] $\phi$ an [[Isomorphism]]
