In [Linear Algebra](Linear%20Algebra), Two [Vector Spaces](Vector%20Space.md) are $V$ and $W$ are *Isomorphic*, if there exists a [Linear Transformation](../MAT223%20Notes/Linear%20Transformation.md) $T:V\rightarrow W$ that is an [Isomorphism](Isomorphism.md)
- If two vector spaces have the same [Dimension](../MAT223%20Notes/Dimension.md), they are isomorphic

>Isomorphisms of vector spaces are a way to describe the way some vector spaces are really "the same", even though the elements may be written in different ways 

In [Group Theory](Group%20Theory), Two [Groups](../MAT301%20Notes/Group.md) $(G,*), (H,\circ)$ are *isomorphic* if there exists a [Bijection](../MAT301%20Notes/Bijective.md) $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ such that for all $a,b\in G$, $\phi(a*b)=\phi(a)\circ \phi(b)$
Also:
- $\phi(e_G)=e_H$ 
- $\phi(g^{-1})=\phi(g)^{-1}$
Denoted $G\cong H$ if $G$ and $H$ are [Isomorphisms](Isomorphism.md)

The [Bijection](../MAT301%20Notes/Bijective.md) $\phi$ is called an [Isomorphism](Isomorphism.md)

# Group Theory
Two [Groups](../MAT301%20Notes/Group.md) $(G,*), (H,\circ)$ are *isomorphic* if there exists a [Bijection](../MAT301%20Notes/Bijective.md) $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ such that for all $a,b\in G$, $\phi(a*b)=\phi(a)\circ \phi(b)$
Also:
- $\phi(e_G)=e_H$ 
- $\phi(g^{-1})=\phi(g)^{-1}$

## Notation
Denoted $G\cong H$ if $G$ and $H$ are *isomorphic*
We call the [Bijection](../MAT301%20Notes/Bijective.md) $\phi$ an [Isomorphism](Isomorphism.md)
