In Group Theory, an **Isomorphism** is a [[Function]] $\phi$ which is [[Bijective]], and such that
$$\phi(ab)=\phi(a)\phi(b)$$

# Linear Algebra

In Linear Algebra, A Linear Transformation is an Isomorphism if it is Invertible

If $T:V\rightarrow V$ is a linear transformation of a two-dimensional [[Vector Space]] $V$, $T$ is an [[Isomorphism]] if and only if $det([T]_{a}^{a})\neq 0$

# Group Theory
An **Isomorphism** is a [[Function]] $\phi: G\rightarrow H$ which is [[Bijective]], and such that
$$\phi(ab)=\phi(a)\phi(b)$$
If there exists an *isomorphism* between [[Group|Groups]] $G$ and $H$, then we can say $G$ and $H$ are [[Isomorphic]]


## Properties
- The order of an element under an *isomorphism* is: $o(g)=o(\phi(g))$ 
	- A function with this property is not necessarily an isomorphism
- For groups $G,H$ with generators $G=\langle g_{1},...,g_{k}\rangle$, the isomorphism $\varphi: G\rightarrow H$ is uniquely determined by what it maps the generators of $G$ to
- An Isomorphism from a group $G$ to itself, is called an [[Automorphism]]
