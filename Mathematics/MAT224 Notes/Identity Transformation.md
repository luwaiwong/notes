The **Identity Transformation** is a [Linear Transformation](../MAT223%20Notes/Linear%20Transformation.md) which always outputs the [Vector](../MAT223%20Notes/Vector.md)  that was input.

The **identity Transformation** is one that doesn't do anything  
The matrix of a $k$ [Dimensional](../MAT223%20Notes/Dimension.md) identity transformation $T:V\rightarrow V$, is the $k\times k$ matrix $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\  & . \\  &   & .\\ &   &   &  1\end{bmatrix}$
