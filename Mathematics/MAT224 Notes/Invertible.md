A [Function](../MAT235%20Notes/Function.md) or [Transformation](../MAT223%20Notes/Transformation.md) being **Invertible**, means that it has an [Inverse](Inverse.md)

# Matrices
An $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is called [Invertible](.md) if there exists an $n\times n$ [Matrix](Matrix.md) $A$ is called *invertible* if there exists an $n\times n$ matrix $B$ so that $AB=BA=I$. $B$  is called the *[Inverse](Inverse.md)* of $A$ and is denoted by $A^{-1}$

# Group Theory
A [Residue Class](../MAT301%20Notes/Residue%20Class.md) $[a]$ is [Invertible](.md) if there exists a $[b]$ such that $[a][b]=[1]$
