A [[Function]] or [[Transformation]] being **Invertible**, means that it has an [[Inverse]]

# Matrices
An $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is called [[Invertible]] if there exists an $n\times n$ [[Matrix]] $A$ is called *invertible* if there exists an $n\times n$ matrix $B$ so that $AB=BA=I$. $B$  is called the *[[inverse]]* of $A$ and is denoted by $A^{-1}$

# Group Theory
A [[Residue Class]] $[a]$ is [[invertible]] if there exists a $[b]$ such that $[a][b]=[1]$
