A **Field** is a [[Set]] $F$ with two operations, defined on ordered pairs of elements of $F$, called addition and multiplication

The properties of a field, come from [[Vector Space|Vector Spaces]], which are abstracted so that they can fit [[Complex Numbers]]

# Definition
A **Field** is a [[Set]] $F$ with two operations, defined on ordered pairs of elements of $F$, called addition and multiplication
These two operations must satisfy the following properties for all $x,z$ and $z\in F$
- usual properties, commutativity, associativity

> Same properties as vector spaces, find them [[Vector Space|Here]]

## Algebraically Closed
A field $F$ is called **Algebraically Closed** if:
	Every polynomial $p(z)=a_{n}z^{n}+...+a_{1}z+a_{0}$ with $a_{1}\in F$ and $a_{n}\neq 0$ has $n$ roots counted with multiplicity in $F$
- $C$ is algebraically closed, and $C$ is the smallest algebraically closed field containing $\mathbb{R}$
