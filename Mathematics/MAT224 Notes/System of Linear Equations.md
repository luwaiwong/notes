A **System of Linear Equations** is a system of $m$ equations with $n$ unknowns $x_{1},...x_{n}$, in the form:
$$\begin{aligned} a_{11}x_{1}+...+a_{1n}x_{n}&=b_{1}\\a_{21}x_{1}+...+a_{2n}x_{n}&=b_{2}\\\vdots \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \\a_{m1}x_{1}+...+a_{mn}x_{n}&=b_{m}\end{aligned} $$

# Properties
- A system is [[Homogenous]], if all $b_{i}=0$, and [[Inhomogenous]] otherwise
	- If a system is homogenous, and $m<n$, then it has a nontrivial solution
- Two **Systems of Linear Equations** are **Equivalent** if their sets of solutions are the same
	- A system obtained by adding any multiple of any one equation to any second equation, is an equivalent system
	- A system obtained by multiplying any one equation by a nonzero scalar and leaving the others unchanged is an equivalent system
	- The system obtained by interchanging any two equations is an equivalent system

# Elementary Operations 
The [[Elementary Operations]] are operations that can be done on **Systems of Linear Equations**, which retains the values of the linear operation
