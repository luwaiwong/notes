A **Dihedral** [[Group]] is one that is [[Generator|Generated]] by a pair of *nontrivial (identity) involutions*

Geometrically, A **Dihedral Group** $D_{n}$ is the set of reflections and rotations of a shape with $n$ sides
	A flip (reflection) is denoted as $f$, and a rotation is denoted as $r$
Following the "two involutions" definition, $f$ and $fr$ are two involutions which generate all of $D_{n}$

# Definition
> Dihedral groups have two definitions, the *geometric* and *two involutions* definitions

A **Dihedral** [[Group]] is one that is [[Generator|Generated]] by a pair of *nontrivial (identity) [[Involution|Involutions]]* which satisfy $frf=r^{-1}$

Geometrically, A **Dihedral Group** $D_{n}$ is the set of reflections and rotations of a shape with $n$ sides
	A flip (reflection) is denoted as $f$, and a rotation is denoted as $r$
Properties
- The [[Order]] of $f$ is 2
- [[Order]] of $r$ could be anything
- If $o(r)$ is finite, $o(G)=2o(r)$

Every element of $D_{n}$ can be written as either $r^k$ or $fr^{k}$, where:
$$G=\{e,r,r^{2},...,r^{n-1},f,fr,fr^{2},...,fr^{n-1}\}$$
- Every element is distinct

## Presentation of 
The [[Presentation]] $D_{n}$ is:
$$D_{n}=\langle r,f|r^{n}=e,f^{2}=e,frf=r^{-1}\rangle$$

## Notation
With the *two involutions* definition, is denoted $G=\langle a,b\rangle$

With the *geometric definition*, is denoted $G=\langle r,f\rangle$

## Properties
- [[Subgroup|Subgroups]] of dihedral groups are either *dihedral* or *cyclic*
- Any two dihedral groups of the same order are isomorphic
- $D_{n}$ is abelian [[IFF]] $n=1$ or $2$
- $o(D_{n})=2n$

Related to Isomorphisms
- Any two dihedral groups of the same order are [[Isomorphic]]
- An [[Isomorphism]] $\varphi$ for a dihedral group $D_{n}$ must map
	- $\varphi(r)=r^{a}$ such that $gcd(a,n)=1$
	- $\varphi(f)=fr^{b}$ for some $b$ ($\varphi$ cannot send $f$ to a rotation) 

The [[Center]] of $D_{n}$ is: 
$$Z(D_{n})=$$

## Flips and Rotations
 The fundamental relation between flip and rotation, is the identity $frf=r^{-1}$

Because of this identity, every element of $G$ can be written as either $r^{k}$ or $fr^{k}$ for some integer $k$

Other properties
 - $(r^{i})(fr^{j})=fr^{j-i}$
 - $(fr^{j})(r^{i})=fr^{j+i}$
## Subgroups
Subgroups of dihedral groups are either *dihedral*, or [[Cyclic Group|Cyclic]]

Let $G$ be a dihedral group and let $H\leq G$. Then $H$ is either:
- [[Cyclic Group|Cyclic]]: $\langle r^{k}\rangle$ where $k=\frac{1}{2}[G:H]$ ([[Index]])
- Dihedral: $\langle r^{k}, fr^{i}\rangle$ where $k=[G:H]$ and $0\leq i<k$
	Proof in Problem Set 3


## Two Involutions vs. Geometric Definition
>We can merge the two definitions together with the following theorems

Let $G$ be a dihedral group with generating involutions $a$ and $b$. $G$ is generated by the:
- Flip $f=a$
- Rotation $r=fb$
Where
- $f$ and $r$ are distinct
- $frf=r^{-1}$

And if a group $G$ is generated by two distinct elements $f$ and $r$ such that 
- $o(f)=2$
- $frf=r^{-1}$
Then $G$ is [[Dihedral Group|Dihedral]] with generating involutions $f$ and $fr$
