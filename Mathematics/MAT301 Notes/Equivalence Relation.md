An **Equivalence Relation** is a [[Relation]] which is [[Reflexive]], [[Symmetric]], and [[Transitive]]
Denoted with $\sim$ 

The [[Equivalence Class]] for an **Equivalence Relation** $\sim$ is the complete set of elements which are related to one another with $\sim$

Recall, A relation is:
- [[Reflexive]] if all elements are related to themselves, $xRx$ for all $x$
- [[Symmetric]] if the relation goes both ways, if $xRy$ then $yRx$
- [[Transitive]] if you can "remove the middleman" in a chain of relations, if $xRy$, $yRz$, then $xRz$
