An **Equivalence Relation** is a [Relation](../../Computer%20Science/CSC236/CSC236%20Notes/Relation.md) which is [Reflexive](Reflexive.md), [Symmetric](../../Computer%20Science/CSC236/CSC236%20Notes/Symmetric.md), and [Transitive](../../Computer%20Science/CSC236/CSC236%20Notes/Transitive.md)
Denoted with $\sim$ 

The [Equivalence Class](Equivalence%20Class.md) for an **Equivalence Relation** $\sim$ is the complete set of elements which are related to one another with $\sim$

Recall, A relation is:
- [Reflexive](Reflexive.md) if all elements are related to themselves, $xRx$ for all $x$
- [Symmetric](../../Computer%20Science/CSC236/CSC236%20Notes/Symmetric.md) if the relation goes both ways, if $xRy$ then $yRx$
- [Transitive](../../Computer%20Science/CSC236/CSC236%20Notes/Transitive.md) if you can "remove the middleman" in a chain of relations, if $xRy$, $yRz$, then $xRz$
