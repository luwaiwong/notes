Properties
- For a [Group](Group.md), every row on its corresponding Cayley table must be a [Permutation](../../Statistics/STA237%20Notes/Permutation.md), otherwise its corresponding [Composition Law](Composition%20Law.md) would not have a valid inverse for every element
- Groups with a Cayley table which is symmetric about the diagonal is [Abelian](Abelian.md)
