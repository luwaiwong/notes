An **Abelian** [Group](Group.md), is one where its [Binary Operation](Binary%20Operation.md) is [Commutative](Commutative.md)  
	Sometimes composition law in abelian groups are denoted with a plus sign +

Definition of Commutative:![Commutative](Commutative.md)  
Properties
- A [Binary Operation](Binary%20Operation.md) which has a [Cayley Table](Cayley%20Table.md) symmetric about the diagonal will be abelian

Abelian Groups
- $\mathbb{Z} \backslash n \mathbb{Z}$ forms an abelian group under addition,
	- Not a group under multiplication though
