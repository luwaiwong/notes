An **Abelian** [[Group]], is one where its [[Binary Operation]] is [[Commutative]]
	Sometimes composition law in abelian groups are denoted with a plus sign +

Definition of Commutative:![[Commutative]]
Properties
- A [[Binary Operation]] which has a [[Cayley Table]] symmetric about the diagonal will be abelian

Abelian Groups
- $\mathbb{Z} \backslash n \mathbb{Z}$ forms an abelian group under addition,
	- Not a group under multiplication though
