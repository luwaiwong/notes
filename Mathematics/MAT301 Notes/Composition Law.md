A [Composition Law](.md) is an [Associative](Associative.md) [Binary Operation](Binary%20Operation.md)

> Recall:
> 	An operation $*$ is **Associative** if $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$

A Composition Law is the [Binary Operation](Binary%20Operation.md) for a [Group](Group.md)

---
## Notation
> There are many notations for [Composition Laws](.md), but when we're dealing with a single group and only one composition law, we can use **Multiplicative Notation**, and not write a symbol for the composition law at all
> 	So writing $ab$ instead of $a*b$ 

Under **Multiplicative Notation**, the *product* of two elements $a,b$ is $a*b$ 

The **Power** $g^{n}$ of an element in a group $G$ with $e$, and $g\in G$. $\forall n\in \mathbb{Z}$, is defined:
	If $n>0, g^{n}=g\cdot...\cdot g$ 
	If $n<0, g^{n}=(g^{-1})^{-n}$
	If $n=0, g^{0}=e$
Follows [Exponent Laws](Exponent%20Laws.md)

> With the definition of $g^{n}$ we can simplify long expressions such as:
> 	$aabbbcddd=a^{2}b^{3}cd^{4}$
> 	For [Abelian](Abelian.md) groups written **Additively**, $g^{n}$ can be written $ng$
> Note the definition of groups does **not** include $a*b=b*a$ ([Commutativity](Commutative.md))

If a [Composition Law](.md) is [Commutative](Commutative.md), we call its corresponding [Group](Group.md) [Abelian](Abelian.md)
	Sometimes people write the composition law in abelian groups using a plus sign +
	Never assume Commutativity
