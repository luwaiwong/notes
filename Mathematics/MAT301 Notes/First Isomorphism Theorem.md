The **First Isomorphism Theorem** states that if $f:G\to H$ is a [Homomorphism](Homomorphism.md), then $G /ker \ f \cong im \ f$

The **Second Isomorphism Theorem** or also known as **Diamond Theorem**

> Note:  
> 	Vector spaces are abelian groups under addition, and the first isomorphism theorem can be used to give a neat proof of the *Rank Nullity* theorem from linear algebra  
> 	(See page 117 in the lecture notes)
