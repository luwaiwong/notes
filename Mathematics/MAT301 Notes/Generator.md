A **Generator** is an element, or a set of elements, of which its *products*, under a [Composition Law](Composition%20Law.md), *generate* a group

A **Generator** for a [Cyclic Group](Cyclic%20Group.md) $G$ is an element $g$, such that $\forall a\in G, \exists i\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $g^{i}=a$. Denoted $G= \langle g\rangle$ if $g$ is a generator for the group $G$

For [Subgroups](Subgroup.md), $\langle S\rangle$, or *the subgroup generated by $S$* is the set of all possible combinations of the elements of $S$ (and their inverses), using the [Composition Law](Composition%20Law.md) in $G$
$$\langle S\rangle = \{g_{1}^{+1},...,g_{k}^{+1}:k\geq 0 \ \text{ and } \ g_{i}\in S\}$$
- The generated group always includes the *empty product* or $e$
