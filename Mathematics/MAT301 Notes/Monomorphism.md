A **Monomorphism** is a [Homomorphism](Homomorphism.md) which is [Injective](../MAT224%20Notes/Injective.md)

Properties
- Every [Monomorphism](.md) $f_{1}:G\hookrightarrow H$ yields an [Isomorphism](../MAT224%20Notes/Isomorphism.md) onto its image $f_{2}: G\overset{\sim}{\to} f_{1}(G)$
	- Because of this, monomorphisms are also called *embeddings*
