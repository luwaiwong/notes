The **Greatest Common Divisor** of two numbers $a$ and $b$ is the largest natural number that is a factor of both $a$ and $b$
	Or the largest natural number which [Divides](Division.md) both $a$ and $b$
Denoted $gcd(a,b)$

Properties
- If $c | a$ and $c|b$, then $c|gcd(a,b)$ 
- $gcd(a,b)\cdot lcm(a,b)=|ab|$
