A **Subgroup** of a [Group](Group.md) $G$ is a subset $H\subset G$ with the same **Group Operation**

Denoted $H\leq G$, if $H$ is a **subgroup** of $G$
	$H\subseteq G$ means that $H$ is a **subset** of $G$

---
## Properties
- Subgroups are also groups themselves
- $H\leq G$ if and only if $H$ is non-empty and $ab^{-1}\in H$ for all $a,b\in H$
- An arbitrary [Intersection](Intersection) of subgroups, is always a subgroup/group
- The [Union](Union) of two subgroups $H,K\leq  G$ is only a subgroup if and only if $H\leq K$ or $K\leq H$
- If $S\subseteq G$ then $\langle S \rangle \leq G$ ([Generator](Generator.md))

### Subgroups
- Given a group $G$ and its subgroup $H$, The *Conjugate Subgroup*, or *[Stabilizer](Stabilizer.md)* is the set of elements in $G$, which under the [Action](Action.md) $g'.gH=(g'g)H$, sends $gH$ to itself 

## Generating Subgroups
$\langle S\rangle$, or *the subgroup generated by $S$* is the set of all possible combinations of the elements of $S$ (and their inverses), using the [Composition Law](Composition%20Law.md) in $G$

$$\langle S\rangle = \{g_{1}^{+1},...,g_{k}^{+1}:k\geq 0 \ \text{ and } \ g_{i}\in S\}$$
- The generated group always includes the *empty product* or $e$
- If $S\subseteq G$ then $\langle S \rangle \leq G$ ([Generator](Generator.md))
## Checking That a Subset is a Subgroup
To check if a subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a **Subgroup**, we must show
- $ab\in H$ for all $a,b\in H$ (The operation in $G$ restricted to $H$ is still a binary operation) <- ==MOST IMPORTANT==
- $e\in H$ (Identity Element)
- $a^{-1}\in H$ for all $a$ in $H$ (Inverse in $G$ of every element of $H$ is in $H$)

We can also use the *Subgroup Criterion* where $H\subseteq G$ if and only if:
- $H$ is *non-empty*
- $a(b)^{-1}\in H$ for all $a,b$ in $H$

Can also show that,
- $H\subset G$
- $H$ is non-empty 
- $ab^{-1}\in H$ for all $a,b$ in $H$
