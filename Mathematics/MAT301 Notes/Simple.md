A **Simple** [Group](Group.md) $G$, is one where the only two [Normal](../MAT235%20Notes/Normal.md) [Subgroups](Subgroup.md) in $G$ are the trivial subgroup $\{e\}$, and $G$ itself

Both $\{e\}$ and $G$ are also called the *trivial normal subgroups* of $G$  
	For any group, the trivial subgroup $\{e\}$, and $G$ itself are always normal subgroups of $G$
