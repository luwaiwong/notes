A **Simple** [[Group]] $G$, is one where the only two [[Normal]] [[Subgroup|Subgroups]] in $G$ are the trivial subgroup $\{e\}$, and $G$ itself

Both $\{e\}$ and $G$ are also called the *trivial normal subgroups* of $G$
	For any group, the trivial subgroup $\{e\}$, and $G$ itself are always normal subgroups of $G$
