A **Binary Operation** on a [[Set]] $S$ is a [[Function]] $\star:S\times S \rightarrow S$

---
# Definition
A binary operation on a [[Set]] $S$ is one which takes pairs of elements from $S$, or elements from $S\times S$  ([[Cartesian Product]])

> Remember:
> 	Elements of $S\times S$ are *ordered pairs* $(a,b)$ with $a$ and $b$ both in $S$

A [[Cayley Table]] visualizes the results of a [[Binary Operation]]

Every [[Group]] has an [[Associative]] **Binary Operation**
### Examples of Binary Operations
- Addition on Integers
	- Is a binary operation $+:\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$
	- Pair $(a,b)$is set to its sum $a+b$

# Properties 
For a set $S$ and binary operation $*$

A binary operation is [[Commutative]] if $a*b=b*a$ $\forall a,b\in S$
A binary operation is [[Associative]] if $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$
