A **Binary Operation** on a [Set](../MAT223%20Notes/Set.md) $S$ is a [Function](../MAT235%20Notes/Function.md) $\star:S\times S \rightarrow S$

---
# Definition
A binary operation on a [Set](../MAT223%20Notes/Set.md) $S$ is one which takes pairs of elements from $S$, or elements from $S\times S$  ([Cartesian Product](Cartesian%20Product.md))

> Remember:  
> 	Elements of $S\times S$ are *ordered pairs* $(a,b)$ with $a$ and $b$ both in $S$

A [Cayley Table](Cayley%20Table.md) visualizes the results of a [Binary Operation](.md)

Every [Group](Group.md) has an [Associative](Associative.md) **Binary Operation**
### Examples of Binary Operations
- Addition on Integers
	- Is a binary operation $+:\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$
	- Pair $(a,b)$is set to its sum $a+b$

# Properties 
For a set $S$ and binary operation $*$

A binary operation is [Commutative](Commutative.md) if $a*b=b*a$ $\forall a,b\in S$  
A binary operation is [Associative](Associative.md) if $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$
