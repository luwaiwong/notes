The **Presentation** of a [[Group]] $G$ is a way of describing a group, which takes the form:
$$G=\langle S|R\rangle$$
Where $S$ is a set of [[Generator|Generators]] for $G$ and $R$ is a list of [[Relation|Relations]] they satisfy

> Implicit in every presentation is that the relations are "complete"
> 	The generates satisfy *no other relations* except for those that you can prove from $R$
