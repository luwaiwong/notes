The **Presentation** of a [Group](Group.md) $G$ is a way of describing a group, which takes the form:  
$$G=\langle S|R\rangle$$  
Where $S$ is a set of [Generators](Generator.md) for $G$ and $R$ is a list of [Relations](../../Computer%20Science/CSC236/CSC236%20Notes/Relation.md) they satisfy

> Implicit in every presentation is that the relations are "complete"  
> 	The generates satisfy *no other relations* except for those that you can prove from $R$
