An **Equivalence Class** is a *complete* set of elements that are all related to one another with an [Equivalence Relation](Equivalence%20Relation.md) (A Relation which is [Reflexive](Reflexive.md), [Symmetric](../../Computer%20Science/CSC236/CSC236%20Notes/Symmetric.md), and [Transitive](../../Computer%20Science/CSC236/CSC236%20Notes/Transitive.md)) $\sim$
	The equivalence class of an element $x$ is the set $[x]=\{y\in X: x\sim y\}$
	One set $S$ may have *multiple equivalence classes*, representing different subsets of elements within $S$, which are related to one another via $\sim$

Denoted $[x]$ for the equivalence class of $x$

Properties
- Equivalence Classes in a set $S$ *partition* $S$ 
- Equivalence classes are only on sets with [Equivalence Relations](Equivalence%20Relation.md)
