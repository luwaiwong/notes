An **Equivalence Class** is a *complete* set of elements that are all related to one another with an [[Equivalence Relation]] (A Relation which is [[Reflexive]], [[Symmetric]], and [[Transitive]]) $\sim$
	The equivalence class of an element $x$ is the set $[x]=\{y\in X: x\sim y\}$
	One set $S$ may have *multiple equivalence classes*, representing different subsets of elements within $S$, which are related to one another via $\sim$

Denoted $[x]$ for the equivalence class of $x$

Properties
- Equivalence Classes in a set $S$ *partition* $S$ 
- Equivalence classes are only on sets with [[Equivalence Relation|Equivalence Relations]]
