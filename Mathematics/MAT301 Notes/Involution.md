A [Function](../MAT235%20Notes/Function.md) $f:X\rightarrow X$ is an **Involution** if it's its own [Inverse](../MAT224%20Notes/Inverse.md)

An element $g$ is an **Involution** if it is its own [Inverse](../MAT224%20Notes/Inverse.md)

**Properties**
- If the [Order](Order.md) of a cyclic group is even, it has [Involutions](.md) $g^\frac{n}{2}$ and $e$, otherwise it has no [Involutions](.md) other than $e$
