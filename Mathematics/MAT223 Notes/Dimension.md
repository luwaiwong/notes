The **Dimension** is a numerical value that describes the size of a [[Subspace]] 

---
# Definition

The [[Dimension]] of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ is the number of vectors in any [[Base (Basis)]] of $V$ 

>For a [[Vector Space]] $W$ defined by a System of Linear Equations, the [[Dimension]] of $W$ is the number of free variables in echelon form

>Since [[Base (Basis)]]s are the most simple form for a [[Subspace]], and all **bases** for a **subspace** have the same number of elements ([[Base (Basis)#^7d8441]]), The **Dimension** describes this number of elements

## Properties
- The subspace $W$ of a vector space $V$ has $dim(W) \leq dim(V)$
- $dim(W) = dim(V)$ only if $W=V$
- $dim(W_{1}+W_{2})=dim(W_{1})+dim(W_{2})-dim(W_{1}\cap W_{2})$
>The **dimension** of two vector spaces added together, is the total number of unique dimensions in the sum
