The **Null Space** is the set of [[Vector]]s that get mapped to the zero vector under a [[Linear Transformation]]

---

# Formal Definition & Notation
The **null space**(or **kernal**) of a [[Linear Transformation|Linear Transformation]] $T:V\rightarrow W$ is the [[Set]] of [[Vector]]s that get mapped to the zero vector under $T$: $$null(T)=\{ \vec{x} \in V : T\vec{x}=\vec{0} \}$$

The [[Nullity]] of the **Null Space** is the [[Dimension]] of the null space of $T$
