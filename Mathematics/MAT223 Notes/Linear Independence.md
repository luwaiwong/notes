A set of [Vectors](Vector.md) $v_{1},...,v_{m}$ is [Linearly Independent](.md) if the only solution for $a_{1},...,a_{m}\in \mathbb{F}$ to the equation:  
$$a_{1}v_{1}+...+a_{m}v_{m}=0$$  
Is $a_{1}=...=a_{m}=0$

> A set of vectors is [Linearly Independent](.md) if there is only one [Linear Combination](Linear%20Combination.md) of them which results in 0, and that is, when all the scalars are 0  
> If you imagine the concept geometrically, a set of vectors is **Linearly Independent** if none of them  "lie on the same path".  
> 	If there were two vectors in the set, where $v_{1}=a\cdot v_{2}$ (where one vector is the same as another vector scaled), then one linear combination of 0 could be $v_{1}-a\cdot v_{2}=0$, which means there is a $a_{1}=...=a_{m}\neq 0$ where $a_{1}v_{1}+...+a_{m}v_{m}=0$  
> 	Thus, for a set of vectors to be [Linearly Independent](Linearly%20Independent), they must not have any two vectors which "lie on the same path"
