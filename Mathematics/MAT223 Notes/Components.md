The **component [[Vector|vectors]]** $\vec{i}, \vec{j}, \vec{k}$ are unit vectors that point in the direction of the positive x,y, and z-axes, respectively

Vectors can be resolved to **components**. Resolving vectors onto components parallel to the axes converts a vector from its **magnitude** and **direction** into a direction defined by points in a cartesian coordinate system.

You can imagine a vectors **components** on its axes as the length of its **shadow** that it casts on its axes

# Vectors in Component Form
A displacement vector $\vec{v}$ from the origin to the point (3,2) can be written as a sum of component displacement vectors along the x and y-axes as
$\vec{v} = 3\vec{i} + 2\vec{j}$
We **resolve** $\vec{v}$ into components by writing $\vec{v}$ in the form $$\vec{v} = v_{1}\vec{i}+ v_{2}\vec{j} + v_{3}\vec{k}$$Where $v_{1}, v_{2},v_{3}$ are [[Scalar]]s, and $v_{1}\vec{i}, v_{2}\vec{j}, and \ v_{3}\vec{k}$ are the **components** of $\vec{v}$


The **displacement vector** from the point $P_{1}=(x_{1},y_{1},z_1)$ to the point $P_{2}=(x_{2},y_{2},z_2)$ is given in components by $$\vec{P_{1}P_{2}}=(x_{2}-x_{1})\vec{i}+(y_{2}-y_{1})\vec{j}+(z_{2}-z_{1})\vec{k}$$
For a **two dimensional vector** $\vec{v}$, given its **length and direction** with length $v$ and making an angle of $\theta$ with the x-axis, if $\vec{v}=v_{1}\vec{i}+v_{2}\vec{j}$, then $$v_{1}=vcos\theta \ \text{  and } \ v_{2}=vsin\theta$$
