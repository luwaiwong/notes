The [Orientation of a Base](.md) represents the direction that a base is pointing in, and can be either **right handed** or **left handed**.

---

An ordered basis $B =\{ \vec{b}_1,...,\vec{b}_n\}$ is considered **right handed** or **positively oriented** if it can be **continuously transformed**[#^44cd90](#^44cd90) to the [Standard Basis](Standard%20Basis.md) (with $\vec{b}_{i}\rightarrow \vec{e}_i$) while remaining [linearly independent](Linear%20Independence.md) throughout the transformation. 
Otherwise, $B$ is called **left handed** or **negatively oriented**


The [Standard Basis](Standard%20Basis.md), or for a 2D space $\varepsilon = \{\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} \}$ would be considered **right handed**. However reversed, $\varepsilon_1 = \{\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \}$  would be considered **left handed**

An [Orthonormal base](Orthonormal.md) is **right handed**, if it can simply be rotated to match the [Standard Basis](Standard%20Basis.md), otherwise, it is **left handed**

A *reflection* reverses the orientation of a vector

# Continuously Transformed

^44cd90
**Continuously Transformed** essentially just means rotating one axis of a vector continuously

This is what it means graphically for a vector to become linearly dependent while being continuously transformed
