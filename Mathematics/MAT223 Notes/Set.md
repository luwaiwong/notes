An unordered collection of distinct objects. These objects can be variables, numbers, other sets, as long as they are distinct

# Set Notation
### Basics
$A\cup B$ (A **Union** B)  
	The **Union** of set A and B, or where **either A or B or both occur**  
$A\cap B$ (A **Intersects** B)  
	The **Intersection** of set A and B, where **both A and B occur**  
$A^c$ (A **Complement**)  
	The **Complement** of A, where **A does not occur**

### Combinations 
$A\cap B^c$ (A **but not** B)  
	When **A occurs and B doesn't occur**  
$A^{c}\cap B^c$ (**Not** A and **Not** B)  
	When **neither A nor B occur**

### Sets
- Empty Set: $\varnothing$ `\varnothing`

[Set Operations](Set%20Operations) can be used to express traits of sets and to manipulate sets

# Common Sets
$\emptyset = \{\} =$ the empty set  
$\mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,3,...\} =$ {natural numbers}  
$\mathbb{Z} = \{...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...\} =$ {integers}  
$\mathbb{Q} =$ {rational numbers}  
$\mathbb{R} =$ {real numbers}  
$\mathbb{R}^{n}=${vectors in *n*-dimensional Euclidean space}
