Another way to describe [[Perpendicular]]. 

Two vectors are **orthogonal** if their [[Dot Product]] equals to $\vec{0}$

# Definition
Two vectors are **orthogonal** if their [[Dot Product]] equals to $\vec{0}$ 

A set of nonzero vectors $v_{1},...,v_{k}\in V$ is called [[Orthogonal]] if $\langle v_{i},v_{j}\rangle = 0$ for $i\neq j$ if in addition $\langle v_{i}, v_{i}\rangle = 1$, 

If a set of vectors are **Orthogonal**, and are [[Unit Vector|Unit Vectors]], then they are [[Orthonormal]]

To project onto a plane in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ that is perpendicular to $n$, use the formula
$$P=I-\frac{nn^{T}}{||n||^{2}}$$
	Where $I$ is the  [[Identity Matrix]]
