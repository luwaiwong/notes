The **Span** (Also called a  **Linear Span**) of a set of [Vectors](Vector.md) $V$ is the set of all [Linear Combinations](Linear%20Combination.md) of vectors in $V$
$$span \ V \ = {\vec{v}:\vec{v} = a_1\vec{v}_{1+}\ ... \ +a_n\vec{v}_{n)}}  \ \forall \ \vec{v}_{1},\vec{v}_{2,}\ ... \ , \vec{v}_{n} \in V \ \& \ \forall \ a_{1},a_{2}, \ ... \ , a_{n}$$

# Properties
- $span\{\} = \{ \vec{0}\}$
- $span(v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{m})$ is a [Subspace](Subspace.md) of $V$, when $v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{m}\in V$ 
- A $span(v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{m})$ is the smallest subspace of $V$ containing each of $v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{m}$
- If $span(v_{1},...,v_{m})=V$, then we say that $(v_{1},...,v_{m})$ **spans** $V$, and $V$ is [Finite Dimensional](../MAT246/MAT246%20Notes/Finite%20Dimensional.md)
	- A vector space that is not finite dimensional is called  [Infinite Dimensional](Infinite%20Dimensional)


Span can also be used as a verb, for example, you can say that the set 
*{(1,1),(1,-2)} spans* $\mathbb{R} ^2$

Any and only Line or Planes which cross through the origin can be expressed as spans
