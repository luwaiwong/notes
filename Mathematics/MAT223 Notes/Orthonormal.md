An **Orthonormal Set** $A$, is a set where each vector is a [[Unit Vector]], and [[Orthogonal]] to each other .

A set of nonzero vectors $v_{1},...,v_{k}\in V$ is called **Orthonormal** if $\langle v_{i},v_{j}\rangle = 0$ for $i\neq j$ and in addition, $\langle v_{i}, v_{i}\rangle = 1$, for  all $i$.

>**Orthonormal Bases** are [[Base (Basis)]]s consisting of **Unit Vectors** **Orthogonal** to one another
