# Functions
## Function of One Variable
For a [Function of One Variable](Function%20of%20One%20Variable.md), **local linearity** means that as we zoom in on the graph, it looks like a *straight line*

## Function of Two Variables
For [Function of Two Variables](Function%20of%20Two%20Variables.md), **local linearity** means that as we zoom in on the graph, it looks like a plane

The **Local Linearization** of a [Function of Two Variables](Function%20of%20Two%20Variables.md), given that it is [Differentiable](Differentiable), is given by the equation of its [Tangent Plane](Tangent%20Plane.md)
