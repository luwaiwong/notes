# Functions
## Function of One Variable
For a [[Function of One Variable]], **local linearity** means that as we zoom in on the graph, it looks like a *straight line*

## Function of Two Variables
For [[Function of Two Variables]], **local linearity** means that as we zoom in on the graph, it looks like a plane

The **Local Linearization** of a [[Function of Two Variables]], given that it is [[Differentiable]], is given by the equation of its [[Tangent Plane]]
