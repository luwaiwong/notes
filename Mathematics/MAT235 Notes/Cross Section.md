The **Cross Section** of a [Function](Function.md) is the shape obtained by the intersection of its graph with a plane, or the its analogues in higher dimensional spaces.

# Cross Sections of Functions of Two Variables
For a [](Function.md#^bd9cf4|Function%20of%20Two%20Variables) $f(x,y)$ ,the function we get by holding $x$ fixed and letting $y$ vary is a **cross section** of $f$ with $x$ fixed, and vice versa.

The **cross section** of $f(x,y)$ at $x=c$ is the **curve** or **cross section** we get by *intersecting* the graph of $f$ with the plane $x=c$. A **cross section** of $f$ with $y$ is defined similarly

Thus, we can calculate the shape of the **cross section** of a function $f(x,y)$ at $c$ as $$z=f(c,y)$$

# Contour Diagrams
Contour diagrams help us visualize the surface of a function and its behaviour, and essentially depict the **Cross Sections** of a function at varying levels

A **Contour Diagram** for a function $f(x,y)$ is a graph of several contours for a selection of constants

- For a **continuous** function, **two contour lines corresponding to different elevations cannot cross each other**
- In a contour diagram with **equally-spaced** constant function values, **contours that are closer together represent a more rapid change of the function**
