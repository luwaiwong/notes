Formulas for calculating distance in multiple dimensions

---
# Calculating Distance in 2D Space
In 2D space, the distance between two points $(x,y)$ and $(a,b)$ is given by the fomula: $$Distance = \sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^2}$$

# Calculating Distance in 3D Space
Similar to 2D space, calculating distance in 3D space can be done using the formula
$$Distance \ = \ \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2+z_1-z_2)^2}$$
