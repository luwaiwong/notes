The **[Tangent](Tangent) Plane** for a [Function of Two Variables](Function%20of%20Two%20Variables.md) at a point is the *flat plane* or [Local Linearization](Local%20Linearization.md) of the function you see when you zoom in at that point. It describes the direction of the function at that point. 

The **Tangent Plane** is the *linear approximation* of its target function around a *tangent point*

# Equation
Given a [Function of Two Variables](Function%20of%20Two%20Variables.md) $f(x,y)$, assuming $f$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$ 
The equation of the tangent plane is: $$L(x,y)=f(a,b)+f_{x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)$$

Given a [Function of Three Variables](Function%20of%20Three%20Variables) $f(x,y,z)$, An equation for the **Tangent Plane** to the level surface of $f$ at the point $(a,b,c)$ is:
	$f_{x}(a,b,c)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b,c)(y-b)+f_{z}(a,b,c)(z-c)=0$
