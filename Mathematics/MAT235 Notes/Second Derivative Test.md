The **Second Derivative Test** is a test to check whether a critical point is a **Local Maximum**, **Local Minimum**, a **Saddle Point**, or if it can not be determined

# Second Derivative Test
Suppose $(x,y)$ is a point where $grad f(x,y) = \vec{0}$  
Let $D=f_{xx}(x,y)f_{yy}(x,y)-(f_{xy}(x,y))^{2}$
  - $D > 0$ && $f_{xx}(x,y) > 0$  $\implies$ $f$ has a **local minimum** at $(x,y)$
  - $D > 0$ && $f_{xx}(x,y) < 0$  $\implies$ $f$ has a **local maximum** at $(x,y)$
  - $D < 0$  $\implies$ $f$  has a **local minimum** at $(x,y)$
  - $D = 0$  $\implies$ inconclusive, $f$ can have local max, min, saddle point, or none at $(x,y)$
