**Contour Diagrams** are created with the [[Cross Section|Cross Sections]] of a [[Function]], usually a [[Function of Two Variables]], held at different points

---
## Definition
A **Contour** of a function $f(x,y)$ is the set of points in the $xy$-plane satisfying $f(x,y)=\text{constant}$, or also known as a [[Cross Section]]

A **Contour Diagram**, such as a topographical map, is a graph of several contours for a selection of constants
It can help us visualize the surface of a function and its behaviour. 
	Example of a Contour Diagram:

> Contour Diagrams are essentially depicting the cross section of a function at certain intervals on an axis. The closer lines are together on the contour diagram, the faster the rate of change for the function at that point.

## Calculation
You can find contours for a function *f* algebraically as long as you have a formula for *f(x,y)*. If the function has the equation $z = f(x,y)$ then the contour for different heights (c) can be obtained by solving $f(x,y)=c$ for different c
