The **Differential** of a [[Function]] computes the approximate change in $f$ given small changes($dx$ and $dy$) in x or y near a point $(a,b)$

The **Differential** is the [[Function#^a77143|Tangent Plane Approximation]] of a [[Function]] $f(x,y)$ at a point $(a,b)$

---
# Definition
The **Differential** of a function $z=f(x,y)$ $df$ (or $dz$), at a point $(a,b)$ is the linear function of $dx$ and $dy$ given by the formula $$df=f_{x}(a,b)dx+f_{y}(a,b)dy$$The differential at a general point is often written as $$df=f_{x}dx+f_{y}dy$$

# Deriving the Differential
The **Differential** for a [[Function of Two Variables]] is derived from the definition of the [[Tangent Plane]]
