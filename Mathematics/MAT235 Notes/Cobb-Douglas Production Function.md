The **Cobb-Douglas Production Function** has the form $P=f(N, V)=cN^{\alpha}V^\beta$, where P is the quantity produced and $c,\alpha$, and $\beta$ are positive constants, $0 < \alpha < 1$ and $0 < \beta < 1$

# Economics
## Notation
Mathematically, the *Cobb-Douglas Production Function* is:
$$Q=AK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha} $$
	Where:
	$Q$ is Quantity
	$A$ is [Total Factor Productivity Growth(Technological Change)](../../Economics/ECO200%20Notes/Total%20Factor%20Productivity%20Growth(Technological%20Change).md)
	$K$ is Capital
	$L$ is Labour

## Solving for [Cost Minimization](../../Economics/ECO200%20Notes/Cost%20Minimization.md)
At the optimal cost minimization, the [Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution](../../Economics/ECO200%20Notes/Marginal%20Rate%20of%20Technical%20Substitution.md) equals the ratio of the input prices (Remember utility optimization from chapter 4). Thus we want to find: $$MRTS_{LK}=\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}}=\frac{W}{R}$$
Given the [Cobb-Douglas Production Function](.md), we can plug those values in for [Marginal Product](../../Economics/ECO200%20Notes/Marginal%20Product.md), giving us: $$\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}}=\frac{(1-\alpha)K}{\alpha L}=\frac{W}{R}$$Which can be rearranged to derive$$K=[\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\frac{W}{R}]L$$
This can then be substituted back into the original production function $$\overline{Q}=AK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}$$
Which we can then use to derive the optimal capital and labour

**The cheapest way of producing $\overline{Q}$ units of output is to use $$([\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\frac{W}{R}]^{1-\alpha}\frac{Q}{A} \ \ \ , \ \ \ [\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\frac{R}{W}]^{\alpha}\frac{Q}{A})$$

## Expansion Path
To plot the expansion path of a firm, we can calculate the cost minimization at various quantities, and plot them on a graph

For a *Cobb-Douglas Production Function*, we know that for the optimal cost: $$K=[\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\frac{W}{R}]L$$Thus the expansion path will be linear with the slope: $$\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\frac{W}{R}$$
