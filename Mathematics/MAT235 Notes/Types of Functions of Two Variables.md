Types of [Functions](Function.md) for [Functions of Two Variables](Function%20of%20Two%20Variables.md)

### Linear Functions: 
The shape of [Linear Function](Linear%20Function.md) in 3D space is a [Plane](Plane.md)  
If a **plane** has slope $m$ in the x-direction and slope $n$ in the y-direction, and passes through the the point $(x_{0},y_{0},z_0)$, then its equation can be defined as;$$\begin{aligned} z=z_0+m(x-x_0)+n(y-y_{0)} \\ f(x,y)=z_0+m(x-x_0)+n(y-y_{0)} 

\end{aligned}$$Writing $c=z_{0}-mx_{0}-ny_{0}$, then we can write $f(x,y)$ as: $$f(x,y)=c+mx+ny$$
- A plane/linear function can be defined by any 3 points
- A linear function can be recognized from its table from these features
	- Each row and column is linear
	- All rows have the same slope
	- All the columns have the same slope
- The [Contour Diagram](Contour%20Diagram.md) of a linear function is simply evenly spaced, straight parallel lines
