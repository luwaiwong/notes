**Cylindrical Coordinates** are a coordinate system based on [Polar Coordinates](Polar%20Coordinates.md), but extended on the z-axis, such that it resembles a cylinder in **3-Space**

---
## Conversion
In **Cylindrical Coordinates**, points in 3-space are represented with $0 \leq r < \infty, 0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi, -\infty < z < \infty$, where $$\begin{aligned} x &= r\cos \theta \\ y &= r \sin \theta \\ z &=z\end{aligned}$$

## Integration

[Integrating](Integral.md) in Cylindrical Coordinates is very similar to integrating in [Polar Coordinates](Polar%20Coordinates.md), just now with an added z-axis

Since **Cylindrical Coordinates** exist in 3-Space, most integration done with cylindrical coordinates will be computing **Triple Integrals**  
When computing triple integrals in cylindrical coordinates, convert the integrand to be in terms of $r, \theta, z$ and set $dV=r dr d \theta dz$
