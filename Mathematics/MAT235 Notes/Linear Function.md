Geometrically, a **Linear Function** is the shape/element you get, when you zoom in infinitesimally small into a function of a [Dimension](../MAT223%20Notes/Dimension.md)
- For typical [Function of One Variable](Function%20of%20One%20Variable.md), Linear Functions create *Lines*
- For [Function of Two Variables](Function%20of%20Two%20Variables.md), Linear functions are [Planes](Plane.md)
