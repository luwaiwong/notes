A plane is a [Linear Function](Linear%20Function.md) of a [Function of Two Variables](Function%20of%20Two%20Variables.md) in 3-Space

---
# Formula
If a **Plane** has slope $m$ in the x-direction, slope $n$ in the y-direction, and passes through the point $(x_{0},y_{0}z_{0})$, then its equation is:  
$z=z_{0}+m(x-x_{0})+n(y-y_{0})$

> Just as in 2-space, a line is determined by two points, so in 3-space a plane is determined by 3 points, provided they do not lie on a line
