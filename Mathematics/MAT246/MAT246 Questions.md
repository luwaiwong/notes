Proof Exercises
5. Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}$ and suppose that $U$ is a subspace of $V$ for which $dim(U)=dim(V)$ prove that $U=V$

6. Let $\mathbb{F}_{m}[z]$ denote the vector space of all polynomials with degree less than or equal to $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$ and having coefficient over $\mathbb{F}$, and suppose that $p_{0},p_{1},\dots,p_{m}\in \mathbb{F}_{m}[z]$ satisfy $p_{j}(2)=0$. Prove that $(p_{0},p_{1},\dots,p_{m})$ is a linearly dependent list of vectors in $\mathbb{F}_{m}[z]$
	**Solution:** 
		Note that every vector $p_{i}$ can be written as $(z-2)(q_{i}(z))$, because $2$ is a factor. Then we can rewrite
		$a_{1}p_{1}+\dots+a_{n }p_{n}=0$ as $(z-2)(a_{1}q_{1}+\dots a_{n}q_{n})$. But since there are $n$ polynomials in $(a_{1}q_{1}+\dots a_{n}q_{n})$, but $q_{i}\in F_{m-1}[z]$, then the list consists of $n$ polynomials in a space of dimension $n-1$, and the list must be linearly dependent

		And each $[v_{1}]_{b}=(1,0,\dots,0), [v_{2}]_{b}=(0,1,\dots,0), [v_{n}]_{b}=(0,0,\dots,1)$, and each $[v_{1}]_{b}$ is the $i$th vector of the canonical basis of $\mathbb{F}^{n}$

Prove that there exists a scalar $\alpha\in \mathbb{F}$ such that $T=\alpha I_{V}$ where $I_{V}$ denotes the identity map on $V$

Notation Notes:
	$p_{m}$ is the set of polynomials

Questions 
1. Explain why each linear functional is surjective or is the zero map
	**Solution**
	- Show that if a functional is not a zero map, than the element not mapped to zero $v^{0}\in V$ can be used to obtain any other value $y$
	- For any $y$, $f(v)=f(\frac{y}{f(v_{0})}v_{0})=\frac{y}{f(v_{0})}f(v_{0})=y$ 
	- This works because linear functionals are *linear*
3. Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $v\in V$ with $v\neq 0$ Prove that there exists $\varphi\in V'$ such that $\varphi(v)=1$
	**Solution**
	- ChatGPT solution is to create a $\varphi$ which satisfies this relationship
	- Alternatively, construct a basis using $v$, the [[Dual Basis]] created for $V'$ will include a $\varphi\in V'$ such that $\varphi(v)=1$
5. Suppose $T\in L(V,W)$ and $w_{1},...,w_{m}$ is a basis of range $T$. Hence for each $v\in V$ there exist unique numbers $\varphi_{1}(v),...,\varphi_{m}(v)$ such that 
$$Tv=\varphi_{1}(v)w_{1}+...+\varphi_{m}(v)w_{m}$$
	thus defining functions $\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{m}$ from $V$ to $F$. Show that each of the functions $\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{m}$ is a linear functional on $V$
	**Solution**
	- We already know $\varphi: V\rightarrow F$
	- Need to show that $\varphi_{1},\dots,\varphi_{m}$ are [[Linear Transformation|Linear]] functions
	- Is true because of linearity of $T$

8. Suppose $v_{1},...,v_{n}$ is a basis of $V$ and $\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{n}$ is the dual basis of $V'$. Define $\Gamma:V\rightarrow F^{n}$ and $\Delta:F^{n}\rightarrow V$ by
$$\Gamma(v)=(\varphi_{1}(v),...,\varphi_{n}(v))$$
	And
$$\Delta(a_{1},...,a_{n})=a_{1}v_{1}+...+a_{n}v_{n}$$
	Explain why $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ are inverses of each other
	**Solution**
	- Want to prove that $\Gamma(\Delta(a_{1},...,a_{n}))=a_{1}v_{1}+\dots+a_{n}v_{n}$ and $\Delta(\Gamma(v))=v$

9. Suppose $m$ is a positive integer. Show that the dual basis of the basis $1,x,...,x^{m}$ of $p_{m}(\mathbb{R})$ is $\varphi_{0},\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{m}$, where
$$\varphi_{k}(p)=\frac{p^{(k)}(0)}{k!}$$
	Here $p^{k}$ denotes the $k^{th}$ derivative of $p$, with the understanding that the $0^{th}$ derivative of $p$ is $p$
	**Solution**
	- Show that dual basis criteria is fulfilled, namely that $\varphi_{k}(p)=1$ if $p=x^{k}$ and $\varphi_{k}(p)=0$ otherwise

11. Suppose $v_{1},...,v_{n}$ is a basis of $V$ and $\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{n}$ is the corresponding dual basis of $V'$. Suppose $\psi\in V'$. Prove that
$$\psi=\psi(v_{1})\varphi_{1}+...+\psi(v_{n})\varphi_{n}$$
	**Solution**
	- Use the fact that $\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{n}$ is a base for $\psi$, where $\psi(v)=(c_{1}\varphi_{1}+\dots+c_{n}\varphi_{n})(v)$ 

12. Suppose $S,T\in L(V,W)$
- Prove that $(S+T)'=S'+T'$
- Prove that $(\lambda T)'=\lambda T'$ for all $\lambda\in F$
	This exercise asks you to verify $(a)$ and $(b)$ in 3.120
	**Solution**
	- Use definition of [[Dual Map]], where for $\varphi\in W'$ $S'=\varphi(S(v))$ 
	- These are true because of linearity of $\varphi \in W'$

13. Show that the dual map of the identity operator on $V$ is the identity operator on $V'$
	**Solution**
	- Use definition of the dual map of a function $Id_{V}\in L(V,V)$
	- for $\varphi\in V'$, $(Id'_{V}\varphi)(v)=\varphi(Id_{V}(v))=\varphi(v)$

16. Suppose $W$ is finite-dimensional and $T\in L(V,W)$. Prove that $T'=0\iff T=0$ 
	**Solution**
	- Use definition of $T'$. For $\varphi\in W'$, $(T'\varphi)(v)=\varphi(Tv)=0$

25. Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{m}\in V'$. Define a linear map $\Gamma:V\rightarrow F^{m}$ by $\Gamma(v)=\varphi_{1}(v),...,\varphi_{m}(v)$  
	- Prove that $\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{m}$ spans $V'$ if and only if $\Gamma$ is injective
	- Prove that $\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{m}$ is linearly independent if and only if $\Gamma$ is surjective
	**Solution** 
	1. Prove Injective
		- If $\varphi_{1},\dots , \varphi_{m}$ span $V'$, then if $\Gamma(v)=0$, then all $\varphi_{1}(v)=\dots = \varphi_{m}(v)=0$, but since $\varphi_{1},\dots , \varphi_{m}$ span $V'$, this is only possible if $v=0$, so kernel of $\Gamma(v)$ is 0 
		- If $\Gamma$ is injective, but $\varphi_{1},\dots , \varphi_{m}$ does not span $V'$, then there exists a $\varphi$ in [[Dual Basis]] of $V$ which is not represented, and for some $v$, $\varphi_{1}(v)=\dots = \varphi_{m}(v)=0$, thus $\Gamma$ cannot be injective
	2. Prove Surjective
		- If $\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{m}$ is linearly independent, then the rank of $\Gamma$ is $m$, and $\Gamma$ is surjective
		- If $\Gamma$ is surjective, then for all $v\in V$, there exists some $c_{1},\dots ,c_{m}$ where $v=c_{1}\varphi_{1}(v)+\dots+c_{m}\varphi_{m}(v)$. If $\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{m}$ are linearly dependent, then that implies there is some $v\neq 0$ where $v=c_{1}\varphi_{1}(v)+\dots+c_{m}\varphi_{m}(v)=0$, which is a contradiction and $\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{m}$ must be linearly independent

32. The *double dual space of $V$*, denoted by $V''$ is defined to be the dual space of $V'$, in other words, $V''=(V')'$. $\Lambda:V\rightarrow V''$ by
$$(\Lambda v)(\varphi)=\varphi(v)$$
	For each $v\in V$ and each $\varphi\in V'$
	- Show that $\Lambda$ is a linear map from $V$ to $V''$
	- Show that if $T\in L(V)$, then $T''\circ\Lambda=\Lambda\circ T$, where $T''=(T')'$
	- Show that if $V$ is finite-dimensional, then $\Lambda$ is an isomorphism from $V$ onto $V''$
		Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then $V$ and $V'$ are isomorphic. but finding an isomorphism from $V$ onto $V'$ generally requires choosing a basis of $V$. But the isomorphism $\Lambda$ from $V$ onto $V''$ does not require a choice of basis and thus is considered more *natural*

Questions
3E
1. Suppose $T$ is a function of $V$ to $W$. The *graph* of $T$ is the subset of $V\times W$ defined by 
$$\text{graph of $T$}=\{(v,Tv)\in V\times W:v\in V\}$$
	Prove that $T$ is a linear map if and only if the graph of $T$ is a subspace of $V\times W$
		*Formally, a function $T$ from $V$ to $W$ is a subset $T$ of $V\times W$ such that for each $V\in V$, there exists exactly one element $(v,w)\in T$. In other words, formally a function is what is called above its graph. We do not usually think of functions in this formal manner. However, if we do become formal, then this exercise could be rephrased as follows: Prove that a function $T$ from $V$ to $W$ is a linear map if and only if $T$ is a subspace of $V\times W$*
**Solution**
- $T$ is a linear map if for all $a\in \mathbb{R} v_{1}, v_{2}\in V$, $aT(v_{1}+v_{2})=T(av_{1})+T(av_{2})$ 
- If the graph of $T$ is not a subspace of $V\times W$, then there exists some $v_{1},v_{2}\in V$ and $k\in \mathbb{R}$ where
	- $(v_{1},Tv_{1})+(v_{2},Tv_{2})\notin \text{graph of T}$   
		- Since $v_{1}+v_{2}\in V$ then the issue must be that
		- There is no $v\in V$ where  $Tv = Tv_{1}+Tv_{2}$. thus $Tv_{1}+Tv_{2}\neq T(v_{1}+v_{2})$ because there exists
	- Or $k(v_{1}, Tv_{1})\neq \text{graph of T}$

5. For $m$ a positive integer, define $V^{m}$ by $V^{m}=V\times ...\times V$ ($m$ times). Prove that $V^{m}$ and $L(F^{m},(V))$ are isomorphic vector spaces
	**Solution**
	- Consider the map $\varphi: V^{m}\rightarrow L(F^{m},V)$, where for $v=(v_{1},...,v_{m})\in V^{m}$ and $f=(f_{1},\dots,f_{m})\in F^{m}$, is defined as $\varphi(v)(f) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}f_{i}v_{i}$
		- Show that $\varphi$ is a bijection
		- Verify Injectivity by showing only element in Kernel 
		- For any $T\in L(F^{m}, V)$, define $(v_{1},\dots, v_{m})\in V^{m}$ by $v_{i}=T(e_{i})$ where $e_{i}$ is the $i$-th standard basis vector for $F^{m}$
			- Thus for any $T$ there is a $v$ where $\varphi(v)=T$, thus it is a surjective

9D
1. Suppose $v\in V$ and $w\in W$. Prove that $v\otimes w=0$ if and only if $v=0$ or $w=0$
	**Solution**
	- Assume by contradiction that $v\neq 0$, $w\neq 0$, then there must be $\varphi\in V',\psi \in W'$ where $\varphi(v)\neq 0,\psi(w)\neq 0$
	- Thus there must be $(v\otimes w)(\varphi,\psi)=\varphi(v)\psi(w)\neq 0$, this contradicts assumption
	- For other direction is obvious

3. Suppose that $v_{1},...,v_{m}$ is a linearly independent list in $V$. Suppose also that $w_{1},...,w_{m}$ is a list in $W$ such that 
$$v_{1}\otimes w_{1}+\dots+v_{m}\otimes w_{m}=0$$
	Prove that $w_{1}=\dots=w_{m}=0$
	**Solution**
	- Since $v_{1},...,v_{m}$ is linearly then for every $i=1,\dots,m$ there exists $\varphi_{i}\in V'$ where $\varphi_{i}(v_{j})=\begin{cases}1, \ \text{ if } i=j \\ 0, \ \text{ if } i\neq j\end{cases}$ 
	- Pick $\varphi_{i}$ where $\varphi_{i}(v_{i})=1$, then $0=(v_{1}\otimes w_{1}+\dots+v_{m}\otimes w_{m})(\varphi_{i},\psi)=\sum\limits_{j=1}^{m}\varphi_{i}(v_{j})\psi(w_{j}) =\psi(w_{i})=0\implies w_{i}=0$  

5. Suppose $m$ and $n$ are positive integers. For $v\in \mathbb{F}^{m}$ and $w\in \mathbb{F}^{n}$. Identity $v\otimes w$ with an $m$-by-$n$ matrix as in Example 9.76. With that identification. show that the set
$$\{v\otimes w:v\in \mathbb{F}^{m} \text{ and } w\in \mathbb{F}^{n}\}$$
	is the set of $m$-by-$n$ matrices (with entries in $\mathbb{F}$) that has rank at most one.
	**Solution**
	- Define $v=(v_{1},v_{2},\dots, v_{m})$, $w=(w_{1},w_{2},\dots,w_{n})$ and a matrix $A=(w_{jk})_{j=1,\dots,m; k=1,\dots n}$
	- Define every column $A_{k}=w_{k}\begin{bmatrix} v_{1} \\ \vdots \\ v_{m}\end{bmatrix}$ 
	- Thus, each column is a scalar multiple of $v$, and so there is only one linearly independent column in $A$, so $A$ has rank 1
	- For any $A$, take $v$ as the column vector corresponding to the first column of $A$, and take $w_{n}$ as the coefficient of the $n$th column in relation to the first column of $V$

9. Suppose $S\in L(V)$ and $T\in L(W)$. Prove that there exists a unique operator on $V\otimes W$ that takes $v\otimes w$ to $Sv\otimes Tw$ for all $v\in V$ and $w\in W$
	-  In an abuse of notation, the operator on $V\otimes W$ given by this exercise is often called $S\otimes T$
	**Solution**
	- Consider the operator $\Gamma: V\times W\rightarrow V\otimes W$ where $(v,w)\rightarrow (Sv\otimes Tw)$
	- Because $S$ and $T$ are linear, and bilinearity of $\otimes$, $(v,w)\rightarrow (Sv\otimes Tw)$ is bilinear
	- By universal property of tensor products, there exists $\hat \Gamma(v\otimes w)=\Gamma(v,w)$

10. Suppose $S\in L(V)$ and $T\in L(W)$. Prove that $S\otimes T$ is an invertible operator on $V\otimes W$ if and only if both $S$ and $T$ are invertible operators. Also, prove that if both $S$ and $T$ are invertible operators, then $(S\otimes T)^{-1}=S^{-1}\otimes T^{-1}$. where we are using the notation from the comment after Exercise 9
	**Solution**
	- Prove $S\otimes T$ is invertible only if both $S$ and $T$ are invertible
		- Assume $S\otimes T$ is invertible, assume contradiction that either $S$ or $T$ are not invertible, then there exists $v$ or $w$ where $(S\otimes T)(v\otimes w)=(Sv\otimes Tw)=0$
		- Then $0\neq v\otimes w$, but $v\otimes w\in ker(S\otimes T)$, so contradiction that $S\otimes T$ is invertible
		- Thus $S\otimes T$ is invertible if and only if $S$ and $T$ are invertible
	- Prove if both $S$ and $T$ are invertible, $(S\otimes T)^{-1}=S^{-1}\otimes T^{-1}$
		- Consider $A:V\times W\rightarrow V\otimes W$ where $(v,w)\rightarrow (S^{-1}v\otimes T^{-1}w)$ show this map is bilinear, and by universal property, there exists $\hat A:V\otimes W\rightarrow V\otimes W$ where
		- Similarly get $\hat \Gamma: V\otimes W\rightarrow V\otimes W$ where $(v\otimes w)\rightarrow (Sv\otimes Tw)$
		- Show $\hat A(\hat\Gamma)(v\otimes w)=v\otimes w$ and $\hat \Gamma(\hat A)(v\otimes w)=v\otimes w$ and that $\hat  A$ and $\hat \Gamma$ are inverses, thus $(S\otimes T)^{-1}=S^{-1}\otimes T^{-1}$

12. Suppose that $V_{1},...,V_{m}$ are finite-dimensional inner product spaces. Prove that there is a unique inner product on $V_{1}\otimes \dots \otimes V_{m}$ such that
$$\langle v_{1}\otimes\dots\otimes v_{m}, u_{1}\otimes\dots\otimes u_{m}\rangle=\langle v_{1},u_{1}\rangle \dots \langle v_{m},u_{m}\rangle$$
	for all $(v_{1},...,v_{m})$ and $(u_{1},...,u_{m})$ in $V_{1}\times \dots \times V_{m}$
		Note that the equation above implies that $||v_{1}\otimes \dots\otimes v_{m}||=||v_{1}||\times \dots\times ||v_{m}||$
		for all $(v_{1},...,v_{m})\in V_{1}\times \dots\times V_{m}$ 
	**Solution**
	- Define an inner product on $V_{1}\otimes \dots \otimes V_{m}$
	- Uniqueness, there is only one inner product on $V_{1}\otimes \dots \otimes V_{m}$ such that $\langle v_{1}\otimes\dots\otimes v_{m}, u_{1}\otimes\dots\otimes u_{m}\rangle=\langle v_{1},u_{1}\rangle \dots \langle v_{m},u_{m}\rangle$ because  every element of $V_{1}\otimes \dots \otimes V_{m}$ can be written as a linear combination of elements of the form $v_{1}\otimes \dots \otimes v_{m}$

13. Suppose that $V_{1},\dots,V_{m}$ are finite-dimensional inner product spaces, and $V_{1}\otimes\dots\otimes V_{m}$ is made into an inner product space using the inner product from Exercise 12. Suppose $e_{1}^{k},\dots,e_{n}^{k}$ is an orthonormal basis of $V_{k}$ for each $k=1,\dots,m$. Show that the list 
$$\{e_{j_{1}}^{1}\otimes\dots\otimes e_{j_{m}}^{m}\}_{j_{1}=1,\dots,n_{1};,\dots;j_{m}=1,\dots,n_{m}}$$
	Is an orthonormal basis of $V_{1}\otimes\dots\otimes V_{m}$
	**Solution**
	- We know that if $dim V_{k}=n_{k}$ $e^{k}_{1},\dots,e^{k}_{n_{k}}$ is a basis of $V_{k}$ for $k=1,\dots,m$, then $\{e^{1}_{j_{1}}\otimes \dots\otimes  e^{m}_{j_{m}}\}_{j_{1}=1,\dots,n_{1};\dots;j_{m}=1,\dots,n_{m}}$ is a basis of $V_{1}\otimes \dots \otimes V_{m}$ 
	- $\langle e^{1}_{1}\otimes e^{2}_{1},\dots, e^{1}_{n_{k}}\otimes e^{2-1}_{n_{k-1}}\rangle=\langle e^{j}_{1}=$
	- Thus it is an orthonormal basis
