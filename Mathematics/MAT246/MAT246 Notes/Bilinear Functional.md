A **Bilinear Functional** on $V\times W$ ([Product of Vector Spaces](Product%20of%20Vector%20Spaces.md)) is a function $\beta:V\times W\to  F$ such that
- $v\rightarrow \beta(v,w)$ is a linear functional on $V$  for each $w\in W$, and
- $w\rightarrow \beta(v,w)$ is a linear functional on $W$ for each $v\in V$

## Definition

A **Bilinear Functional** on $V\times W$ ([Product of Vector Spaces](Product%20of%20Vector%20Spaces.md)) is a function $\beta:V\times W\to  F$ such that
- $v\rightarrow \beta(v,w)$ is a linear functional on $V$  for each $w\in W$, and
- $w\rightarrow \beta(v,w)$ is a linear functional on $W$ for each $v\in V$

> Simplification:
> 	Bilinear Functionals are [Functionals](Linear%20Functional.md) for [Products of Vector Spaces](Product%20of%20Vector%20Spaces.md)
> 	They take any product of vector spaces, to a number
> Examples
> 	1.  Suppose $\varphi\in V'$ and $\uptau\in W'$. Define $\beta:V\times W\rightarrow F$ by $\beta(v,w)=\varphi(v)\uptau(w)$. $\beta$ is a bilinear functional
