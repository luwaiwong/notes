The **Dual Space** of a vector space $V$, is the vector space of all [Linear Functionals](Linear%20Functional.md) on $V$

---

# Notes
## Notation
The **Dual Space** of a vector space $V$, is denoted $V'$ 

## Definition
The **Dual Space** of $V$ is the vector space of all [Linear Functionals](Linear%20Functional.md) on $V$
	$V'=L(V,F)$

The [Dual Basis](Dual%20Basis.md) of any [Base (Basis)](../../MAT223%20Notes/Base%20(Basis).md) of $V$, is a basis of $V'$

## Properties
- $\dim V'=\dim V$
