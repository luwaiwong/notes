The **Dual Space** of a vector space $V$, is the vector space of all [[Linear Functional|Linear Functionals]] on $V$

---

# Notes
## Notation
The **Dual Space** of a vector space $V$, is denoted $V'$ 

## Definition
The **Dual Space** of $V$ is the vector space of all [[Linear Functional|Linear Functionals]] on $V$
	$V'=L(V,F)$

The [[Dual Basis]] of any [[Base (Basis)]] of $V$, is a basis of $V'$

## Properties
- $\dim V'=\dim V$
