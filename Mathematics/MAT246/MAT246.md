> "The goal of this course is to introduce students to mathematical proofs and abstract mathematical concepts. Both are well illustrated on topics taken from Linear Algebra, which is a core discipline in mathematics and its various applications, all the way to internet search engines and GPS.  
> In the setting of Linear Algebra, we will learn about rigorous definitions, statements and proofs, and about abstract arguments."
