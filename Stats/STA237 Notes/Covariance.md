The [Covariance](.md) of two [Random Variable](Random%20Variable)s is a measure of their *joint variability*, or their *degree of association*

---

# Definition
 Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables. The [Covariance](.md) between $X$ and $Y$ is defined by $$Cov(X,Y)=E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])]$$Alternatively, $$Cov(X,Y)=E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]$$
