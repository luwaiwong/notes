A **Limit** is the value that a [Function](Function.md) (or [Sequence](Sequence)) approaches as the input value approaches some value.

---
## Notation
A function *f(x,y)* has a [Limit](.md) L at the point (a,b), written as $$\lim_{ (x,y)\rightarrow (a,b) }f(x,y) = L$$
## Continuity
A function f(x,y) is [Continuous](Continuous.md) at a point (a,b) if  $$\lim_{ (x,y)\rightarrow (a,b) }f(x,y) = f(a,b)$$And, a function is [Continuous](Continuous.md) on a region if it is continuous at each point in the region
