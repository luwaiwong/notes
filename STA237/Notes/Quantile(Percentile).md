A **Quantile** describes what percentage of a population is lower than a value of a [Continuous Random Variable](Continuous%20Random%20Variable.md)

---
# Definition
Let $p$ be a number between 0 and 1, the *p*th **quantile** or 100*p*th **percentile** of the [distribution](../../STA238/STA238%20Notes/Probability%20Distribution.md) of a [Continuous Random Variable](Continuous%20Random%20Variable.md) Y is the smallest number $q_{p}$ such that $$F(q_{p})=P(Y \leq q_{p})=p$$
Or, the the value of the [Cumulative Distribution Function](Cumulative%20Distribution%20Function.md) for $q_{p}$ is $p$
The **median** of a distribution is its **50th percentile or quantile**
