## Chapter 2: Supply and Demand
A [Market](Market) is defined by a specific product being bought and sold, in a particular location, and at a point in time. Buyers should be able to find sellers in a market, and exchange goods.

4 key assumptions underlying the supply and demand model
1. Focus on supply and demand in a single market
2. All goods sold in the market are identical
3. All goods sold in market sell for same price, and everyone has the same information
4. Many producers and consumers in market  
Or, the market is [Perfectly Competitive](Perfectly%20Competitive)

[Demand](Demand) means consumer demand for a product. the demand slope is downwards sloping, as prices go up, quantity demanded goes down (consumers want cheaper products)  
Factors influencing demand
1. Price, higher prices lower demand, lower prices higher demand
2. Number of consumers, more consumers greater demand typically
3. Consumer Income, some goods are more valued when incomes are higher, or vice versa
4. Consumer Tastes, self explanatory
5. Prices of other goods. [Complements and Substitutes](Complements%20and%20Substitutes)

[Supply](Supply) means the producer supply for a product. The supply slope is upwards sloping, as prices go up, producers want to sell more of a good (producer want to sell products at higher price)  
Factors influencing supply
1. Price, higher prices higher demand, lower prices lower supply
2. Cost of production, higher cost of production means higher prices, lower supply (Production Tech)
3. Number of sellers, more sellers more supply
4. Seller other options, other products may have better profit margins, more desirable to sell

[Market Equilibrium](Market%20Equilibrium) is where [Supply](Supply) and [Demand](Demand) meet. It represents the price goods are sold at and the quantity sold. Mathematically and graphically, the market equilibrium is the price and quantity where the supply graph/equation, and demand graph/equation, are the same.

[Elasticity](Elasticity) represents the the responsiveness of the supply or demand curve to changes in the other, similar to the slope. The price elasticity of demand and supply is mathematically represented by: $$\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{(\text{Percent change in quantity demanded/supplied})}{(\text{Percent change in price})}$$ Can also be represented as: $$E^D=\frac{1}{MQ^D}\frac{P}{Q^D}$$  
Other elasticities exist as well, such as **income elasticity of demand**, which is positive for high end goods and negative for **inferior goods**, or the **cross-price elasticity of demand**, which is positive for substitutes and negative for complements

## Chapter 3: Using Supply and Demand to Analyze Markets

[Surplus](Surplus) is the different between the price consumer/producer would be willing to buy/sell a good, and the price they actually pay\sell. It is the amount of "profit" that the consumer or producer is making on the purchase.  
[Surplus](Surplus) can be calculated by the area of the graph above or below the selling price for the consumer or producer

A [Price Ceiling](Price%20Ceiling) sets a limit on the *highest* price that can be paid legally for a good or service. **Price Ceilings** can cause [Excess Demand](Excess%20Demand)  
A [Price Floor](Price%20Floor) sets a limit on is the *lowest* price that can be paid legally for a good or service. **Price Floors** can cause [Excess Supply](Excess%20Supply)

A [Quota](Quota) can either force firms to produce a certain amount of a good, or limit the amount of a good to be sold

All cause [DWL(Deadweight Loss|[Deadweight Loss)](Deadweight%20Loss)](Deadweight%20Loss))), which is the difference between the maximum total **surplus** that consumers could gain from market, and the combined gains they actually make after a price regulation. **DWL** reflects the inefficiency of the price ceiling.

## Chapter 4: Consumer Behaviour

[Assumptions About Consumer Behaviour](Assumptions%20About%20Consumer%20Behaviour.md)  
An assumption we make about consumer preferences are that all decisions about what to buy share 4 properties
1. **Completeness and Rankability**  
	Consumers make comparisons across all possible sets of goods. [Consumption Bundle](Consumption%20Bundle.md)s are any set of goods or services a consumer considers purchasing. Just means that consumers can determine if a bundle of goods are better than another
2. **For most goods, more is better than less (or at least more is no worse than less)**
3. **Transitivity**  
	For any three bundles of goods (A, B and C), if a consumer prefers A to B, and prefers B to C, then she prefers A to C.
4. **Taste for Variety, The more a consumer has of a particular good, the less they are willing to give up of something else to get even more of a good**  
	Basically, consumers like variety. If a consumer already has a lot of something, they are more likely to want something else.

### Utility
[Utility](Utility.md) is a measure of how satisfied a consumer is. **Utility** is a fancy word for happiness or well being.
- should be thought of as *relative*, in terms of whether one bundle of goods provides more or less **utility** compared to another bundle.
- **Utility** allows us to rank all bundles for a particular consumer, but does not determine how much a consumer prefers a bundle. People cannot accurately say how much they like something more

A [Utility Function](Utility%20Function.md) describes the mathematical relationship between what consumers consume, and their level of happiness/well-being/Utility
> Utility Function of two goods $$U=U(J,K)$$


[Marginal Utility](Marginal%20Utility.md) is the **utility** a consumer receives from a 1 unit increase in a good  
	Marginal Utility is "key to understanding the consumption choices a person makes"
> Marginal Utility with Utility Function of a good $J$$$MU_J=\frac{\Delta U(J,K)}{\Delta{J}}$$



### Indifference
A consumer is [Indifferent](Indifferent.md) when a consumer derives the same level of utility from each of two or more consumer bundles

An [Indifference Curve](Indifference%20Curve.md) represents the combination of all the different bundles of goods that gives a consumer the same [Utility](Utility.md)
- Steep indifference curves means the consumer is very willing to substitute the goods
- Flatter indifference curves mean the consumer is not as willing to substitute the goods

> [!Example]-  
> ![Pasted image 20231010233718](Pasted%20image%2020231010233718.png)


### Marginal Rate of Substitution
The [Marginal Rate of Substitution](Marginal%20Rate%20of%20Substitution.md) represents the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade off or substitute exactly 1 unity of good X (good on horizontal axis) for more of good Y (the good on the vertical axis) and feel equally well off, with [Utility](Utility.md) held constant
> Marginal Rate of Substitution $$MRS_{XY}=-\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}$$  
> The Marginal Rate of Substitution is the slope/[Derivative](Derivative.md) at a point of of the [Indifference Curve](Indifference%20Curve.md)  
> Defined with Marginal Utility $$MRS_{XY}=\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{X}}$$

> Marginal Rate of Substitution on Indifference curve  
> ![Pasted image 20231107182231](Pasted%20image%2020231107182231.png)


A [Budget Constraint](Budget%20Constraint.md) describes all the [Consumption Bundle](Consumption%20Bundle.md)s a consumer can purchase by spending all income. 
> For a straight budget constraint with no quantity discounts, the **budget constraint** can be described as: $$Income=P_XQ_X+P_YQ_Y$$

> [!Example]-  
> Budget Constraint Graph  
>Say Sarah wants to purchase burritos and lattes. Sarah has an income of $50 to spend on burritos ($10 each) and lattes ($5 each). The budget constraint for Sarah's purchase could be: ![Pasted image 20231011000329](Pasted%20image%2020231011000329.png)

### Utility Optimization
Combining all of these concepts, we want to find the **optimal bundle** a **consumer** should purchase at a given **budget constraint/income level**, to give the highest **utility**

[Utility Optimization](Utility%20Optimization.md) is a **constrained optimization problem**, and is done to determine the most optimal amount of goods a consumer should purchase.  
The point where utility is optimal will be a bundle where the utility level of an [Indifference Curve](Indifference%20Curve.md)
- Where only one point intersects with the [Budget Constraint](Budget%20Constraint.md)
- The [Marginal Rate of Substitution](Marginal%20Rate%20of%20Substitution.md) is the same as the [Budget Constraint](Budget%20Constraint.md)

[](Utility%20Optimization.md#^e62080|Method%201%20of%20Finding%20the%20Utility%20Maximizing%20Bundle)

### Important Formulas:
$$MRS_{XY}=\frac{MU_{X}}{MU_{X}}$$  
$$MU_J=\frac{\Delta U(J,K)}{\Delta{J}}$$  
$$Income=P_XQ_X+P_YQ_Y$$
## Chapter 4 Appendix: Utility Maximization

^d4ed78

### Another method for Utility Maximization
We know the general steps already to find a [](Utility%20Optimization.md#^e62080|Utility%20Maximizing%20Bundle) 

Using [](Utility%20Optimization.md#^e62080|Method%201), we can use its process to derive that under certain conditions, the budget constraint is: $$(\frac{\alpha I}{P_{X}},\frac{(1-\alpha)I}{P_{Y}})$$  
There is another method we can use, called the **Lagrangian Method**
> [!quote]+
> ### Textbook Explanation of the [Lagrangian Method](Lagrangian%20Method.md)
> "The Lagrangian is a technique for transforming a constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained problem by combining the objective and the constraint into one equation. $\lambda$ is a variable that multiplies the constraint"
> 
> Suppose the objective function is $f(x,y)$ and the constraint is $g(x,y)=0$.  
> The **Lagrangian Equation** is $$L(x,y,\lambda)=f(x,y)+\lambda(g(x,y))$$  
> We can then use the partial derivatives of this equation to solve for the system of equations
### Expenditure Minimization
[Expenditure Minimization](Expenditure%20Minimization.md) is where you start with a level of [Utility](Utility.md), and find the cheapest bundle which achieves that utility level. 

**Expenditure Minimization** is not used as frequently because
- **Utility Maximization** can be used to obtain the same result
- It is less intuitive

## Chapter 5: Individual and Market Demand

Knowing what determines and drives consumer demand is important to understand a number of issues, including
- Why shifts in tastes affect prices
- The benefits that products offer consumers
- What happens to purchase patterns as consumers (or groups of consumers, or entire countries) become wealthier
- How changes in the price of one good affects the demand for other goods
- What factors determine consumers' responses to price changes

### Income Effects
When analyzing how income changes affect consumption choices, we hold everything else constant during our analysis

When the price of a good changes, the demand curve tells us how much consumption will change. The change is the result of two distinct forces affecting consumer decisions
- The [Income Effect](Income%20Effect.md) is the change in a consumer's consumption choices that results from a change in the *purchasing power of the consumer's income*. (price shift changes the purchasing power of a consumers income)  
	*Isolating the **Income Effect*** is easiest done after isolating the **substitution effect**, and finding the difference from the **Total Effect**
- The [Substitution Effect](Substitution%20Effect.md) is the change in a consumer's consumption choices resulting from a change in the *relative prices of two goods*  
	*To Isolate the **substitution effect***, we want to find what the consumer would be purchasing to achieve the same level of utility with the new prices

The total effect of change is $$\text{Total Effect = Substitution Effect + Income Effect}$$
> [!example]+ Graphical Example of the Substitution Effect VS. Income Effect

[](Pasted%20image%2020231102111428.png)rmal goods can be either [Necessity Goods](Necessity%20Goods.md) or [Luxury Goods](Luxury%20Goods.md)  
A good for which **consumption decreases when income rises** is an [Inferior Good](Inferior%20Good.md)

[](Pasted%20image%2020231108200712.png)Income Elasticity](Income%20Elasticity.md) measures the *percentage change in the quantity consumed of a good* in response to a given *percentage change in income*

### Various Graphs and Helpful Tools
The [Income Expansion Path](Income%20Expansion%20Path.md) is a curve that *connects a consumer's optimal bundles at each income level*. It depicts how the consumption between two goods changes over different income levels.

The [Engel Curve](Engel%20Curve.md) is a graph that shows only the relationship between **Income** and **Quantity Consumed** for a single good.

	When the price of one good of a **substitute** rises, the quantity consumed of its **substitute** increases  
Two goods are [Complements](Complements.md) when they are purchased and used in combination with another good  
	When the price of one good of a **complement** rises, the quantity consumed of its **complement** also decreases

The shape of an [Indifference Curve](Indifference%20Curve.md) is related to whether two goods are **substitutes** or **complements**  
	The more curved the indifference curve, the less substitutable (or more complementary) are the goods
## Chapter 5 Appendix: Income/Substitution Effects

> [!Note]+  
> Recall: 
> - The [Income Effect](Income%20Effect.md) is the change in a consumer's consumption choices that results from a change in the *purchasing power of the consumer's income*. (price shift changes the purchasing power of a consumers income)
>- The [Substitution Effect](Substitution%20Effect.md) is the change in a consumer's consumption choices resulting from a change in the *relative prices of two goods*
>- Total Effect = Income Effect + Substitution Effect
### Solving for Income and Substitution Effects
>Review Calculating Optimal Utility  
>Say a two goods $X$ and $Y$ are priced at $P_X$ and $P_Y$, and a consumers [Utility Function](Utility%20Function.md) can be given by:$$U=U(X,Y)=X^{\alpha}Y^{1-\alpha}$$  
>And [Budget Constraint](Budget%20Constraint.md) can be given by: $$I=P_{X}X+P_{Y}Y$$  
>From [Chapter 4 and Appendix 4](#^d4ed78), we can calculate the bundle of goods a consumer should purchase to maximize their [Utility](Utility.md), and this bundle of goods will be:  
>$$X=\frac{\alpha I}{P_{X}}, \ \text{ and } \ Y=\frac{(1-\alpha)I}{P_{Y}}$$


If the price of a good changes from $P_X$, to $P_{X}'$ , we can calculate the total effect simply as the difference in quantity purchased from the original price, to the changed price, or:  
$$\text{Total Effect} = \text{New Bundle After Price Change }-\text{ Original Optimal Bundle}$$

We also want to calculate the [Substitution Effect](Substitution%20Effect.md) and the [Income Effect](Income%20Effect.md)

### Substitution Effect
Given the consumers original utility and original prices, we can use [Expenditure Minimization](Expenditure%20Minimization.md) to find the substitution effect

To do this, calculate the expenditure minimization for the new price, but with the old utility  
Let $U_{1}$ be the original level of Utility, let $U_{2}$ be the new level of utility.

We can use the [Lagrangian Method](Lagrangian%20Method.md) with [Expenditure Minimization](Expenditure%20Minimization.md) such that we are looking for: $$\min_{X,Y}=P_{X}'X+P_{Y}Y$$  
such that:  
$$U_{1}=X^{\alpha}Y^{1-\alpha}$$

Finding the [Partial Derivatives](Partial%20Derivative.md) and then solving for the system of equations for the quantity of goods purchased, we can then find the quantity purchased solely from the substitution effect

### Income Effect
To find the **income Effect**, use the result gained from the **Substitution Effect**, and since $$\text{Total Effect} = \text{Income Effect} + \text{Substitution Effect}$$Then  
$$ \text{Income Effect}= \text{Total Effect} - \text{Substitution Effect}$$  
Income effect can also be calculated as $$X(P_{X};\overline{P_{Y}},\overline{I})=\frac{\alpha \overline{I}}{P_{X}}$$  
==I dont wanna read the slutsky equation rn but check out appendix 5==
### Hicksian Demand Curves
The demand curves we have so far been deriving have been called *Marshallian Demand Curves*. They show the relationship between price and quantity demanded, assuming consumer income stays constant

These demand curves show the [Income Effect](Income%20Effect.md) as well as [Substitution Effect](Substitution%20Effect.md). But sometimes we want a demand curve which only shows the **Substitution Effect**

These curves are "[Hicksian Demand Curves](Hicksian%20Demand%20Curves)", or *compensated demand curves*

> [!quote]- Solving for Hicksian Demand

[](Pasted%20image%2020231110163239.png)t, or non-profit uses inputs to create a good or service for which others are willing to pay*

[Capital](Capital.md) is money  
[Labour](Labour.md) is people

Firms make [Final Goods](Final%20Goods) or [Intermediate Goods](Intermediate%20Goods)
### Assumptions
- Firms produce a single good
- Firms have already chosen which product to produce
- A firm's goal is to minimize the cost of producing it
- Firms use only capital and labour to make its product
- In the short run, a firm chooses to employ as much or as little labour as it wants, but cannot change capital
- In long run, firm can freely choose amount of both labour and capital it employs
- The more inputs the firm uses, the more output it makes
- A firm's production exhibits diminishing marginal returns to labour and capital
- A firm can buy as many capital or labour inputs as it wants at fixed market prices

### The Production Function
The [Production Function](Production%20Function.md) describes how much output can be made from different combinations of inputs  
	In the **short run**, capital is essentially fixed, so the [Production Function](Production%20Function.md) is a one variable function.  
	In the **long run**, firm can control capital and labour,,so the **production function** is two variable function  
	One popular production function is the [Cobb-Douglas Production Function](Cobb-Douglas%20Production%20Function.md)
> [!example]- Example of a Production Function  
> $$Q=f(K,L)$$  
> Where $Q$ is *quantity*, $K$ is *capital* and $L$ is *labour*

[Marginal Product](Marginal%20Product.md) is the additional output that a firm can produce by using an additional unit of input
> [!Example]- Marginal Product of Labour  
> In the short run, the marginal product of labour is the most important  
> The marginal product of labour would be the *change* in quantity ($\Delta Q$) resulting from a 1-unit *change* in labour inputs ($\Delta L$)  
> $$MP_{L}=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}$$

[Average Product](Average%20Product.md) is the quantity of output divided by number of units of input used to produce it, or mathematically:  
$$AP_{L}=\frac{Q}{L}$$



### Isoquants and Isocosts
An [Isoquant](Isoquant.md) is like an [Indifference Curve](Indifference%20Curve.md), it is the combination of input necessary to produce a certain level of output. Each point on the Isoquant represents the **Labour** and **Capital** required to produce a certain quantity of output


>[!Example]- Isoquant Graph Example  
>	![Pasted image 20231106204750](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231106204750.png)
>	

The [Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution](Marginal%20Rate%20of%20Technical%20Substitution.md) is the *negative of the slope of the isoquant*  
$$MRTS_{LK}=-\frac{\Delta K}{\Delta L}=\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}}$$  
	It can also be defined as [Marginal Product](Marginal%20Product.md) of labour over the **Marginal Product** of capital

The [Isocost](Isocost.md) line is the curve that shows the combination of inputs necessary to yield a certain level of cost, The **isocost** is similar to the [Budget Constraint](Budget%20Constraint.md)

### Cost Minimization
[Cost Minimization](Cost%20Minimization.md) is the goal of a firm to produce a specific quantity of output at minimum cost.  
	Cost Minimization can be compared to [Expenditure Minimization](Expenditure%20Minimization.md) from **Chapter 5**  
	The goal, is given a quantity of output, to find the lowest cost to produce this output  
	This can be done by setting an [Isoquant](Isoquant.md) equivalent to the quantity of output, and finding the lowest [Isocost](Isocost.md) that intersects with the **Isoquant**

> [!Example]- Cost Minimization Graphically  
> 	![Pasted image 20231106213255](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231106213255.png)

### Returns to Scale
[Returns to Scale](Returns%20to%20Scale.md) describes a change in the *amount of output in response to a proportional increase in all the inputs*

Improvements in technology which change a firms production, such that it gets more output from the same amount of inputs is [Total Factor Productivity Growth(Technological Change|[Technological Change)](Technological%20Change)](Technological%20Change)).md). When there is **technological change**, a production function changes over times so that a fixed amount of inputs can produce more input. 

A firm's [Expansion Path](Expansion%20Path.md) is a curve that illustrates how the optimal mix of inputs varies with total output. It shows the optimal input combinations at each output quantity. Plotting the total cost from the [Isocost](Isocost.md) and the **output quantity**, we can get the  [Total Cost Curve](Total%20Cost%20Curve.md), a curve which shoes a firm's cost of producing different quantities

## Chapter 6 Appendix:
### Confirming A Production Function Satisfies Assumptions
A [Production Function](Production%20Function.md) must have:
1. Positive marginal product of labour and capital (Adding more labour and capital will always increase production)
2. Labour and Capital exhibit *diminishing marginal returns*

Mathematically, the [Marginal Product](Marginal%20Product.md) of capital is the [Partial Derivative](Partial%20Derivative.md) of the *Production Function* with respect to capital  
	Labour is the same, but with respect to labour

Proving Assumptions
1. To show that marginal product is always positive, we must prove that the marginal product will never be negative
2. To show that *diminishing marginal returns* holds true, the marginal products of capital and labour must **decrease as the amounts of those inputs increase**. To do this, we can find the *second partial derivative* of the production function, and prove that it is negative

### Cost Minimization Using Calculus
>A common production function is the  [Cobb-Douglas Production Function](Cobb-Douglas%20Production%20Function.md)  
	Mathematically, it is:$$Q=AK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha} $$  
		Where:  
		$Q$ is Quantity  
		$A$ is [Total Factor Productivity Growth(Technological Change|[Technological Change)](Technological%20Change)](Technological%20Change)).md)  
		$K$ is Capital  
		$L$ is Labour  
	This production function will be used as an example


With [Cost Minimization](Cost%20Minimization.md), we are given a fixed quantity $\overline{Q}$, and we want to find the optimal capital and labour to a achieve this quantity.  
There are two approaches to solving the cost-minimization problem.
1. Apply cost minimization condition  
	At the optimal cost minimization, the [Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution](Marginal%20Rate%20of%20Technical%20Substitution.md) equals the ratio of the input prices (Remember utility optimization from chapter 4). Thus we want to find: $$MRTS_{LK}=\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}}=\frac{W}{R}$$  
	Given the [Cobb-Douglas Production Function](Cobb-Douglas%20Production%20Function.md), we can plug those values in for [Marginal Product](Marginal%20Product.md), giving us: $$\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}}=\frac{(1-\alpha)K}{\alpha L}=\frac{W}{R}$$Which can be rearranged to derive$$K=[\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\frac{W}{R}]L$$  
	This can then be substituted back into the original production function $$\overline{Q}=AK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}$$  
	Which we can then use to derive the optimal capital and labour

	**The cheapest way of producing $\overline{Q}$ units of output is to use $$([\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\frac{W}{R}]^{1-\alpha}\frac{Q}{A} \ \ \ , \ \ \ [\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}\frac{R}{W}]^{\alpha}\frac{Q}{A})$$  
	of Capital, and Labour, respectively**
2. Use the [Lagrangian Method](Lagrangian%20Method.md)  
	Here, $\lambda$, or the *Langrange Multiplier* is the value of relaxing the constraint by 1 unity.  
	If you increase the given output quantity bu 1 unit, the total cost of production at the optimum increases by $\lambda$ dollars.

### Expansion Path
To plot the expansion path of a firm, we can calculate the cost minimization at various quantities, and plot them on a graph

For a [Cobb-Douglas Production Function](Cobb-Douglas%20Production%20Function.md), we know that for the optimal cost: $$K=[\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\frac{W}{R}]L$$Thus the expansion path will be linear with the slope: $$\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}\frac{W}{R}$$  
This is a property of the *Cobb-Douglas Production Functional Form*

### Isoquants
You can derive the [Isoquant](Isoquant.md) from a production function, by simply holding quantity constant.

## Chapter 7: Costs
### Economic Costs

[Economic Cost](Economic%20Cost.md) are the *sum of a producer's [Accounting Cost](Accounting%20Cost.md)s and [Opportunity Cost](Opportunity%20Cost.md)*  
	[Accounting Cost](Accounting%20Cost.md) is the *direct costs of operating a business*  
	- Costs of raw materials  
	- Cost of wages  
	- Rent paid for real estate  
		[Accounting Profit](Accounting%20Profit.md) is the total revenue minus accounting costs
		
	[Opportunity Cost](Opportunity%20Cost.md) is the *value of what a producer gives up by using an input*
	
	[Economic Profit](Economic%20Profit.md) is the total revenue minus [Economic Cost](Economic%20Cost.md)
 Businesses Make their decisions based on their economic costs and profits
### Other Costs
[Fixed Costs](Fixed%20Cost.md) are costs that do not change based on the amount of goods that a firm produces
- They must be paid even if the firm is producing nothing
- Can only be avoided if a firm completely shuts down  
[Sunk Costs](Sunk%20Cost.md) are fixed costs that can never be recovered, even if the firm completely shuts down
- Should not affect future decisions

[Total Cost](Total%20Cost.md) is the total [Accounting Cost](Accounting%20Cost.md) of a firm  
	Split between  
		- [Fixed Cost](Fixed%20Cost.md)  
		- [Variable Cost](Variable%20Cost.md)

The [Total Cost Curve](Total%20Cost%20Curve.md) is the curve of amount produced to [Total Cost](Total%20Cost.md)  
	Is parallel to the [Variable Cost Curve](Variable%20Cost%20Curve), the curve of amount produced to [Variable Cost](Variable%20Cost.md)

[Average Cost](Average%20Cost.md) is the ratio of cost to output  
	[Average Fixed Cost](Average%20Fixed%20Cost.md) falls continuously as output increases  
	[Average Variable Cost](Average%20Variable%20Cost.md) & [Average Total Cost](Average%20Total%20Cost.md) often rise as output increases  
[Marginal Cost](Marginal%20Cost.md) is the additional cost of making one more unit of output

### Economies
[Economies of Scale](Economies%20of%20Scale.md) describe how the costs of a firm change as output changes  
	If costs increase slower than output (i.e, producing more yields lower costs per unit), firm has **Economies of scale**  
	Otherwise, it has [Diseconomies of Scale](Diseconomies%20of%20Scale.md), or [Constant Economies of Scale](Constant%20Economies%20of%20Scale)  
	A U-shaped [Total Cost Curve](Total%20Cost%20Curve.md) implies that a firm starts off with [Economies of Scale](Economies%20of%20Scale.md), and then turns into [Diseconomies of Scale](Diseconomies%20of%20Scale.md)

[Returns to Scale](Returns%20to%20Scale.md) can be constant or decreasing, even when [Economies of Scale](Economies%20of%20Scale.md) is true.  
	This is because [Returns to Scale](Returns%20to%20Scale.md) applies to a constant increase to all inputs, but it may be better to change the ratio of inputs, which is not accounted for for [Returns to Scale](Returns%20to%20Scale.md)  
	Increasing [Returns to Scale](Returns%20to%20Scale.md) implies [Economies of Scale](Economies%20of%20Scale.md), but not the other way around
	
[Economies of Scope](Economies%20of%20Scope.md) describe how a firm's total cost changes with the amount of types of goods it produces  
	Is producing many types of goods more profitable, or produces just one type of good?  
	If producing many outputs is chapter than producing the same amount of the outputs separately, then the firm has **Economies of scope**  
	Otherwise, the firm has [Diseconomies of Scope](Diseconomies%20of%20Scope)


### Other
[Sunk Cost](Sunk%20Cost.md)s are when capital is spent, and cannot be retrieved, one factor of this is [Specific Capital](Specific%20Capital.md)  
	**Specific Capital** is capital which cannot be used outside of its original application

## Chapter 8: Supply in a Competitive Market
The [Market Structure](Market%20Structure) for an industry results from the number of firms in the market, product sold, and barriers to entry  
Types of market structures
- [Perfect Competition](Perfect%20Competition)
- [Monopolistic Competition](Monopolistic%20Competition)
- [Oligopoly](Oligopoly)
- [Monopoly](Monopoly.md)

### Perfect Competition
[Perfectly Competitive](Perfect%20Competition) markets are markets with a large number of firms selling identical products, with no barriers to entry  
	Firms are **Price Takers** meaning they do not get to set the price, they must sell at market price

## Chapter 11: Imperfect Competition
The industry structure between [Perfect Competition](Perfect%20Competition) and [Monopoly](Monopoly.md) is called [Imperfect Competition](Imperfect%20Competition.md)

One of the types of [Imperfect Competition](Imperfect%20Competition.md) is an [Oligopoly](Oligopoly)  
	[Oligopoly](Oligopoly) is a market structure characterized by competition among a small number of firms  
	Firms have some market power, but not necessarily monopoly, and some competition

For an firm in an **Oligopoly**. market equilibrium depends on the actions on the firm, and of other firms in the market. The behavior of other firms affects the revenue of our firm, and as such affects its decisions  
	This type of equilibrium is called a [Nash Equilibrium](Nash%20Equilibrium)

Firms in an [Oligopoly](Oligopoly) can try to coordinate their production and pricing decisions to collectively act as a monopoly to gain monopoly profits. This behavior is called [Collusion](Collusion), and the organization formed when firms collude is called a [Cartel](Cartel)  
	Calculating equilibrium in an colluding oligopoly is the same as calculating the [Monopoly](Monopoly.md) equilibrium  
	**Collusion** is unstable, firms have a short term incentive to cheat the collusion and make temporary higher profits

[Bertrand Competition](Bertrand%20Competition) is a model where an [Oligopoly](Oligopoly) results in the same equilibrium as a [Perfectly Competitive](Perfectly%20Competitive) market
- Firms produce identical goods
- Choose a price to sell at
- Can produce any quantity

The [Cournot Model](Cournot%20Model) models 
- Firms produce identical goods
- Choose a quantity to produce 
- Firms do *not* control price directly, may control price through quantity  
Prices in the [Cournot Model](Cournot%20Model) are generally above **Bertrand Competition**, but below [Monopoly](Monopoly.md)

[Stackelberg Competition](Stackelberg%20Competition) is where firms make product decisions sequentially
- First mover advantage for starting firm

[Monopolistic Competition](Monopolistic%20Competition) is characterized by many firms selling a differentiated product with no barriers to entry
- Many firms following monopoly pricing rule, but making no profits
- No barriers to entry, economic profit is driven to zero through entry of firms

### Calculations 
For any firm, they will only operate in the short term if they are selling above their **average variable cost**  
**Average Variable Cost** is $\frac{\text{Cost}}{\text{Quantity}}$

#### **Cournot Market Structure**
- Firms produce identical goods
- Choose a quantity to produce 
- Firms do *not* control price

We want to derive the formula for a firms profit, in relation to quantity.  
Then, solve for the quantity value which maximizes profit

We want to find the profit maximizing reaction curve for the firms, and then find where they intersect.
## Chapter 12: Game theory

[Game Theory](Game%20Theory.md) is the study pf strategic interactions among two or more actors  
**Players** are participants in game  
A **Strategy** is a player's plan of action for a game  
**Payoffs** are the outcomes players receive from playing the game

We want to find a player's **optimal strategy**  
A strategy that is always the best thing for a player to do is called a **Dominant Strategy**  
Strategies that are never the right thing for for a player to do are called **Dominated Strategies**

A strategy that a player will always choose with certainty is a **Pure Strategy**  
A strategy where the player randomizes their actions is a **Mixed Strategy**

A [Nash Equilibrium](Nash%20Equilibrium) is an option in a game where neither player would want to change their strategy given whatever the other player is choosing  
	Sometimes there may be **No Nash Equilibrium**, that would be considered a **Mixed Strategy Game**


The **Maximin Strategy** is where the player minimizes their exposure to risk. The player is not going for the highest payoff, but just for the least loss  
	For the example 12.2 below, a **Maximin Strategy** for blue would be selecting **CI**, the **Nash Equilibrium** is for **RS**, but if the other player picked **RS**, then there would be no profit  
	This strategy is good for unpredictable or "stupid" players

> Examples of **Nash Equilibrium**  
> ![400](Pasted%20image%2020240305132607.png) ![400](Pasted%20image%2020240305132812.png) ![350](Pasted%20image%2020240305134453.png)  
> 	For Table 12.2  
> 		The options with checks are best decisions given the other player's moves  
> 		Here, when blue selects RS, and red selects CI, selecting another option would decrease their profit, thus, the **Nash Equilibrium** is the box with two checks  
> 	For Grocery Mart and Food4U  
> 		The middle is the **Nash Equilibrium**  
> 		Here, blue has a **Dominant Strategy** (middle column)  
> 		Red does *not* have a dominant strategy  
> 	For Table 12.5  
> 		There is no **Nash Equilibrium**, therefore is a **Mixed Strategy**


Sometimes there may be **Multiple Nash Equilibria**  
	In that case, then we don't know which the companies will settle on, it is essentially random
 
> Multiple Nash Equilibrium Example  
> ![400](Pasted%20image%2020240305134248.png)  
> 	Here, for both companies, *March* is a **dominated strategy**  
> 	The companies will never pick March

**Repeated Games** are games with a Nash equilibrium played multiple times  
	Following games are for a [Prisoners Dilemma](Prisoners%20Dilemma)  
	For some games, repeated games may encourage cooperation  
	However, if both players know when the game will end, the best option for them will always be to cheat  
	For **Infinitely Repeating Games** however, the players can try to cooperate.  
		They can try to cooperate, but the moment the other player breaks the agreement, then both will end up cheating against each other  
		We can calculate if cooperating is a viable strategy

The **Grim Trigger/Grim Reaper Strategy** in an infinitely repeating game is when:  
	The players cooperate, but cooperative play ends permanently when one player cheats

The **Tit-for-tat Strategy** is when:  
	The player mimics their opponent's prior period action in each round  
	More reflective of reality

**Backward Induction** is a strategy for solving a multistep game  
	Involves solving the last step and then working backward

> Why finite repeated games do not induce cooperation  
>![500](Pasted%20image%2020240305140307.png)  
>	This logic carries for as many repeated games there are.  
>	If there are 50 played games, the players will realize that its best to cheat on the 50th game, meaning that it would be the best to cheat on the 49th game, and so on and so on  
>	This is an example of **Backwards Induction**

**Sequential Games** are situations where players do not make their moves at the same time, they take turns.  
	Sequential games do not work with the decision matrix, instead they use a **Decision Tree**

Sequential games eliminates the **Multiple Equilibriums**, but the outcome is still a **Nash Equilibrium**

> Decision Tree Examples  
> ![425](Pasted%20image%2020240305141621.png) ![450](Pasted%20image%2020240305142328.png) ![400](Pasted%20image%2020240305142824.png)  
> 	Example 1  
> 		The first example is the same as the one before with multiple equilibrium  
> 		Now, since the game is sequential, *Warner Brothers* has a **First Movers Advantage**  
> 		There is no longer multiple equilibrium  
> 	Example 2  
> 		There is no first mover advantage here, both firms have a **Dominant Strategy**

**Strategic Moves** are actions taken early in the game to influence the outcome in a way that benefits the player  
	Such as: Side payments, commitments, reputation building  
	**Side Payments** are a type of *bribe* that influences the outcome of a strategic game  
	**Commitments** are actions a player takes which guarantees that a player will have to take a particular choice in the future  
		**Commitments** serve as sort of a *threat*, that a player will take an option, forcing the opponent to pick another option  
	**Reputations** themselves can be sources of commitment  
		If a player joins a market, and the leading player does not fight them off, then other players will know that they are not willing to fight a price war

One application of strategic moves is a company trying to deter new competitors from entering industry.  
	Players can use **Commitments** which guarantee that they will fight a price war if a new player joins the market  
	Thus players are incentivized not to join the market, as they will be priced out in a price war

> Example of Side Payments  
> ![400](Pasted%20image%2020240305142824.png) ![500](Pasted%20image%2020240305142945.png) ![450](Pasted%20image%2020240305143025.png)  
> 	In Example 1, The best move is for *Danica* to do play.  
> 	Example 2 shows the change in dominant strategy with a promised side payment  
> 	Example 3 shows a punishment for non-cooperation

> Example of **Commitments**  
> ![Pasted image 20240305143527](Pasted%20image%2020240305143527.png) ![400](Pasted%20image%2020240305155408.png) ![425](Pasted%20image%2020240305155430.png)  
> 	Example 1  
> 		For both players, both opening in may would be detrimental, so there were two **Nash Equilibrium** for May, and December.  
> 		One player however, makes a commitment, threatening to do May no matter what.  
> 			This is a **Credible Threat** because they've made a commitment for May  
> 			If they pick December now, they will face greater losses  
> 	Example 2+3  
> 		In example 2, Samsung wants to join the market, because they know Apple's best interest is not to fight them  
> 		In example 3, Apple makes a commitment, so that if Samsung joins the market, then Apple's best interest is to fight them  
> 		In that scenario, Samsung knows it will lose money if it joins, thus it will not join

### Calculation
Calculating if players want to cheat in infinitely repeating games

Taking this game as example  
	![425](Pasted%20image%2020240305141018.png)

A firm would want to cheat in an infinitely repeating game depending on how much they value the future  
	![550](Pasted%20image%2020240305141118.png) ![450](Pasted%20image%2020240305141205.png)  
	$d$ represents how much they value future games

## Chapter 13 Factor Markets

[Factor Markets](Factor%20Markets) are the market for production inputs, such as:
- Labor
- Intermediate goods
- Land

Factor Markets are for anything use to produce outputs  
	Factor Markets are like any other product markets, except the products in factor markets are now an input used by someone else to produce an output.

The **Labor Market** is the market for labor  
	Labor markets are measured by **employee-hours**, the amount of work that an employee works in an hour  
	Employers pay for labor by an hourly wage  
	When firms are choosing the amount of labor to hire, firms have to look at how labor affects their production, and determine what the optimal amount of labor to hire is.  
		Firms analyze this via the **Marginal Revenue Product of Labor**. The **marginal product of labor** times the **marginal revenue**  
	Firms will hire until the **Marginal Revenue Product of Labor = Wage**  
	Labor demand is a **Derived Demand**  
		Derived Demand is a demand for one product that arises from the demand for another product

Changes in any variables that affects labor demand will show up as shifts in the labor demand curve
- Decreases in marginal revenue shift the labor demand graph to the left

At the optimal hiring level $MR=\frac{W}{MP_{L}}$ where $MP_{L}$ is the marginal revenue product of labor

> Example Labor Market  
> ![450](Pasted%20image%2020240305162444.png)


In a perfectly competitive market **Labor Supply** is perfectly elastic, a firm can hire as much labor as it wants at the market wage  
	All shifts in the firm's labor demand will show up as changes in quantity of labor, rather than changes in wage

An individuals labor supply is determined by the trade off between an individuals leisure time vs the consumption of goods they could have achieved if they worked  
	Higher wages would make leisure more expensive for an individual, they would be giving up more money for leisure time  
	Labor supply is influenced by substitution and income effects as well.  
		As the wage increases an individual will work more, because the cost of leisure is higher  
		But, since leisure tends to be a [Normal Good](Normal%20Good.md), as wage gets higher, an individual will value leisure higher. This leads to **Backward Bending Labor Supply Curves**

> Individual labor utility chart examples  
> 	![450](Pasted%20image%2020240305185209.png)![425](Pasted%20image%2020240305195405.png)  
> 	Example 2:  
> 		An example of the **Backward Bending Labor Supply Curve**

Employers tend to have [Monopsony](Monopsony.md) power.  
	They are not price/wage takers, and can set their own wage.  
	They can influence market wage, thus, they operate as a sort of monopoly/[Monopsony](Monopsony.md)  
	Employers will buy the profit-maximizing amount of input

**Labor Unions** Exist

A market structure with major concentrations on both sides of the market is called a [Bilateral Monopoly](Bilateral%20Monopoly), or **Monopoly-monopsony**
 

### Calculation

**Expenditure** is $(W)(L)$, **Marginal Expenditure** is the derivative of **Expenditure**

To find amount of labor which a typical employer will buy, equate **Marginal Revenue Product of Labor** of the first worker with **Wage**  
To find amount of labor which a Monopolistic Employer will buy, equate **Marginal Revenue Product of Labor** with **Marginal Expenditure**
