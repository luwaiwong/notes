### Canadian Diets
- Diet quality in Canada is tending downwards
- Heart Disease is rising, Obesity is rising

### Macronutrients
Food provides nutrients, which are essential to human life
- Essential nutrients must be provided by diet, and cannot be biosynthesized in the body in sufficient quantities
- If essential nutrients are absent from diet, deficiency symptoms/illness will arise, leading to death

Macronutrients provide energy to support basal metabolism and physical activity, and include:
- [Carbohydrates](Carbohydrates)
	- Provides 4 kcal/g
- [Lipids](Lipids)/Fat
	- Provides 9 kcal/g
- [Protein](Protein)
	- When excess is present in diet, is used as a source of energy
	- Provides 4 kcal/g

> Note:  
> 	Basal metabolism is the metabolic activity needed to maintain life at rest, without including energy used for physical activity  
> 	Units of energy for the human bodies are  
> 		Kcalories  
> 		Calories  
> 		Kilojoules  
> 	Alcohol provides 7 kcal/g


#### Lipids or Dietary Fats
The major chemical lipids in food takes the form of *Triglycerides*  
	It is an *ester* of *glycerol* and three fatty acids

Types of [Lipids (Fats)](Lipids%20(Fats))
- Unsaturated fatty acids
	- Fatty acids that contain double bonds
	- Considered to be beneficial to health, reduces risk of cardiovascular disease
	- Found in plant oils:
		- Canola oil
		- Soybean oil
		- Olive oil
- Monounsaturated fatty acids
	- One double bond
	- Found in:
		- Oleic acid found in olive oil
- Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
	- Contains at least two double bonds
	- Found in:
		- Canola oil
		- Soybean oil
- Saturated fatty acids
	- Found in high amounts in fats from animals
	- Associated with increased risk of disease
	- Foods high in saturated fats should be replaced with foods high in unsaturated fats
- Trans fatty acids
	- Found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, margarines, and shortening
	- Associated with increased risk of disease, banned from Canada in 2018

Essential Fatty acids
- Two PUFAs are essential
	- Linoleic acid (Omega-6)
	- Alpha-linolenic acid (Omega-3)
	- Must be obtained from diet
	- Found in oils like canola oil and soybean oil
- Other Omega-3 fatty acids
	- EPA-eicosapentaenoic acid
	- DHA-docosahexaenoic acid
		- Also known as long-chain Omega-3 fatty acids
	- Both synthesized in body from alpha-linolenic acid
	- Also obtained from fatty fish or supplements, linked to cardiovascular health benefits

#### Carbohydrates

Two types of [Carbohydrates](Carbohydrates)  
Digestible
- Starch
	- from rice, wheat, corn, potatoes, cassava, etc.
	- A major source of Kcalories which feed humanity
	- Is digested into glucose
		- Glucose is main carbohydrate that circulates in blood
		- Acts as source of energy for cells, especially brain
- Sugars
	- Includes Sucrose, is disaccharide of glucose and fructose
	- Also includes high fructose corn syrup, mix of glucose & fructoce
		- Sweeteners for sugar sweetened beverages
		- Linked to obesity

Indigestible
- Dietary fibre
	- While grains, legumes, beans, peas, lentils
	- Vegetables and fruit
	- High fibre diets may reduce risk of CVD and colon cancer

#### Proteins
Proteins are *amino acids*, joined by peptide bonds  
Some amino acids are essential/indispensable and some are non essential

### Micronutrients
Micronutrients are [Vitamins](Vitamins) and [Minerals](Minerals)

Vitamins are:
- Organic Compounds
- Two types
	- Fat-soluble
		- Includes vitamins A,D, E & K
		- Stored in liver and adipose tissue
		- Not rapidly depleted from body
		- If intake is extremely high has toxic effects
	- Water-soluble
		- Vitamins B & C
		- Not stored in body
		- Rapidly depleted so needs to be consumed regularly
			- Except B12 which is conserved
		- When consumed in excess excreted in urine

Minerals are:
- Inorganic compounds
- Examples
	- Iron - prevents iron deficiency anemia
	- Iodine - prevents goitre
	- Calcium - maintains bone health

### Phytochemicals
> READ IN TEXTBOOK pg 443-449 TO FINISH

[Phytochemicals](Phytochemicals) are the biologically active non-nutritive chemicals found in plants
- Chemicals which provide biological functions for plants
- When we say "phytochemicals", we generally refer to chemicals which have health promoting properties

Types of Phytochemicals
- Phytoestrogens
	- Appears in soy
	- Have structures similar to estrogen, block or mimic estrogen action
	- Types
		- Isoflavones
		- Lignans
- Phytoserols
	- Resemble cholesterol
	- Compete with cholestorl for absoption in gastrointestinal tract
	- Presence reduces cholesterol absoption
	- Found in broccoli
- Carotenoids
	- Found in carrots, sweet potatoes, acorn squash, apricots, mangos
		- Gives these fruits the yellow-orange  color
	- High intake of carotenoid-containing fruits and vegetables associated with reduced risk of:
		- Certain cancers
		- Cardiovascular disease
		- Age-related eye diseases
	- Carotenoids are phytochemicals with antioxidant properties
		- Some have vitamin A activity
- Polyphenols
	- Plant pigments which add color to vegetables
	- May have protective effect on cardiovascular health

To consume more phytochemicals, eat
- A variety of vegetables and fruits, especially in a variety of colors
- Whole grain foods
- Protein foods, especially plant based proteins
- Food with artificially added phytochemicals

### Nutrition in Diet
Things to consider regarding nutrition:
- Both undernutrition and overnutrition are bad, avoid either when creating diet
- Nutritional genomics, or nutrigenomics is study of interaction between genetic variation and diet
	- Has lead to more personalized nutrition
- Chose foods high in nutrient density
- Eat a variety
- Eat a balanced diet
- Avoid excess kcalorie intake

Two approaches for planning diets
- Nutrient-based approach
	- "How much of a nutrient is required to maintain health?"
- Food-based approach
	- The types and amounts of food to maintain health

[Dietary Reference Intakes](Dietary%20Reference%20Intakes) are official documents, determined by the Institude of Medicine, with Canadian and American scientists, which recommend foods and nutrient intakes
- [](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/dietary-reference-intakes/tables.html#abb)
- DRIs should be used for planning and assessing diets of healthy individuals
- Includes values for different life stages, males or females
- Info includes
	- Estimated Energy Requirement (EER)
	- Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR)
	- For Nutrients
		- Estimated Average Requirement (EAR)
		- Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)
		- Adequate Intake (AI)
		- Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)
		- Chronic Disease Risk Reduction Intake (CDRR)
		- ==Know Abbreviations==

#### Nutrition Intake
How do we determine the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for a nutrient
- EAR is nutrient intake which meats requirement of 50% of individuals in group (sex, age)
	- Used to estimate probability that an individual's usual intake is meeting his/her requirement
- Must determine a biochemical criterion that allows you to determine the intake at which an individual's requirement is being met
- Use that to determine requirement distribution from a sample of the population
- One technique is using *depletion-repletion experiment*
	- Remove nutrient from diet, track level of that nutrient, until none of that nutrient is detected (individual is deficient)
	- Refeed nutrient until individual is saturated with nutrient
	- Amount at which more intake does not increase levels of nutrient in blood is the requirement 
- The *EAR cut point method* is when we use the *Intake Distribution* (Distribution of intake of nutrients of real individuals), and check the population of people consuming *less than* then EAR
	- Helps us determine which populations are satisfying their requirement
	- A population has adequate intake is proportion of population whose intake is below the EAR is 10% or less

> Interpreting DRIs  
> 	DRIs are *probability distributions*, of the amount of nutrient intake, and the percentage of people which meets their requirement with that amount, in a specific group (sex, age)  
> 	![NSF284 Example of EAR Image](attachments/NSF284%20Example%20of%20EAR%20Image.png)  
> 	DRIs tend to look like normal distributions  
> 	The [Cumulative Probability](../../../Statistics/STA237%20Notes/Cumulative%20Distribution%20Function.md) of the value of an individuals intake, is the probability that they are meeting their nutrient intake

An RDA is the *Recommended Dietary Allowance*
- The nutrient intake, which ensures a 98% probability of any individual meeting their requirement (based on the interpretation above)

Adequate Intake
- Used when we have insufficient data to calculate an EAR
- Based on estimate of average nutrient intake by healthy population

Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)
 - The highest level of habitual nutrient intake that is unlikely have adverse effects
 - *NOT* recommended level of intake, no additional benefit above RDA

### Activity Levels and Macronutrients
Activity Levels and Definitions
- Sedentary  
	Less than 30 min of intentional exercise/day
- Low active  
	Walking 30 min at 6.5km/h every day  
	Consumes 135-165kcal
- Active  
	Walking 1h 45min at 6.5km/h every day  
	Consumes 470-580kcal
- Very active  
	Walking 4h 15min at 6.5km/h every day  
	Consumes est1145-1405kcal

Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges
- Is expressed as % of total kcals consumed
- Carbos: 45-65%
- Fat: 20-35%
	- Saturated fat: As low as possible <7-10%
	- Trans Fat: <1% 
- Protein: 10-35%

First lecture continues DRI Slides

In 2019, Canada revised their food guide  
Issues with the old 2007 food guide
- Too prescriptive 
	- Provided too many absolute amounts
	- consumers prefer proportions
- Poor messaging on fat
	- In reality, type of fat is more important than total fat intake
- Not enough emphasis on whole grains
- Food groups too industry-influenced
- Included fruit juice, when in reality juice is not very good

New Food Guide main ideas
- Nutritious foods are foundation for healthy eating
	- Eat vegetables, fruits, whole grans, and proteins 
	- Consume more plant-based proteins
	- Drink water instead of other beverages
- Processed or prepared foods and beverages that contribute to excess sodium, free sugars, or saturated fat undermine healthy eating and should not be consumed regularly
	- Don't consume too much sugary drinks and confectionaries
	- Reduce alcohol intake
	- Limit highly processed foods
- Food skills are needed to navigate the complex food environment and support healthy eating
	- Cooking using nutritious foods should be promoted
	- Food labels should be promoted to help Canadians make informed food choices
