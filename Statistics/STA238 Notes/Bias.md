The **Bias** of an [[Estimator]] is the difference from the [[Expected Value]] of an **Estimator**, to its actual value.

---
# Definition
The **Bias** of an estimator $\hat \theta$ can be calculated by:
	$B(\hat \theta)=E(\hat \theta)-\theta$

> An **Estimator** $\hat \theta$ is said to be **Unbiased**, if $B(\hat \theta)=0$
