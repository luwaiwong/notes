The **Chi^2** distribution is another [Probability Distribution](Probability%20Distribution.md) based off the [Normal Distribution](../STA237%20Notes/Normal%20Distribution.md)

It is used to approximate the [Likelihood Ratio](Likelihood%20Ratio.md)

---
## Definition
If $Z_{1},...,Z_{k}$ are [Independent](Independent.md) [Standard Normal](Standard%20Normal%20Distribution.md) [Random Variables](Random%20Variable.md), then the sum of their squares,
$Q=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}Z_{i}^{2}$

Is distributed according to the **Chi^2** distribution with k degrees of freedom
