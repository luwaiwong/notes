The **Law of Large Numbers** says that as you take more and more samples of a [[Random Variable]] $X$ with the expected value $\mu$, the value of the mean of the samples $\overline X$ will be equal to $\mu$

In other words, as you take more samples of [[Independent Identically Distributed Random Variables]], The average of those values will converge to the [[Expected Value]] of the underlying [[Random Variable]]

> The [[Law of Large Numbers]] **ONLY APPLIES** if **VARIANCE IS FINITE.**
