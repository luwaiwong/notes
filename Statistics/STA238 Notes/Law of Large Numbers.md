The **Law of Large Numbers** says that as you take more and more samples of a [Random Variable](Random%20Variable.md) $X$ with the expected value $\mu$, the value of the mean of the samples $\overline X$ will be equal to $\mu$

In other words, as you take more samples of [Independent Identically Distributed Random Variables](Independent%20Identically%20Distributed%20Random%20Variables.md), The average of those values will converge to the [Expected Value](../STA237%20Notes/Expected%20Value.md) of the underlying [Random Variable](Random%20Variable.md)

> The [Law of Large Numbers](.md) **ONLY APPLIES** if **VARIANCE IS FINITE.**
