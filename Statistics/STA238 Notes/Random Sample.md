A **Random Sample** represents a random sample of observations from an experiment

We conceptualize it as a collection of [[Random Variable|Random Variables]] $X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n}$ following the same [[Probability Distribution]] and each being [[Independent]]
	The term [[Independent Identically Distributed Random Variables]] or $i.i.d$ is often used to describe datasets with these properties

The capital $X_{n}$ represents the [[Random Variable]], of which we are taking random samples of. When we make a real observation, we notate it  $x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}$ as the realizations of those random variables.

> Note the distinction between the [[Random Variable|Random Variables]], and the real observation.
> We conceptualize the idea of observing a random sample, which we use when formulating our calculations, and act as placeholder variables for our actual observations.
> This changes when we observe and collect an actual dataset, and are actually doing calculations
