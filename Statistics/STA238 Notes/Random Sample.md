A **Random Sample** represents a random sample of observations from an experiment

We conceptualize it as a collection of [Random Variables](Random%20Variable.md) $X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n}$ following the same [Probability Distribution](Probability%20Distribution.md) and each being [Independent](Independent.md)
	The term [Independent Identically Distributed Random Variables](Independent%20Identically%20Distributed%20Random%20Variables.md) or $i.i.d$ is often used to describe datasets with these properties

The capital $X_{n}$ represents the [Random Variable](Random%20Variable.md), of which we are taking random samples of. When we make a real observation, we notate it  $x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}$ as the realizations of those random variables.

> Note the distinction between the [Random Variables](Random%20Variable.md), and the real observation.
> We conceptualize the idea of observing a random sample, which we use when formulating our calculations, and act as placeholder variables for our actual observations.
> This changes when we observe and collect an actual dataset, and are actually doing calculations
