**Efficiency** is a measure of how good an [[Estimator]] is at creating a specific [[Estimate]]

## Measuring Efficiency
An estimator $T_{1}$ is more [[Efficient]] than an estimator $T_{2}$ if $Var(T_{2})<Var(T_{1})$, irrespective of the value of $\theta$

The [[Mean Squared Error]] of an estimator $\hat \theta$ is $MSE(\hat \theta)=E[(\theta- \hat \theta)^{2}]=V(\hat \theta)+[B(\hat \theta)]^{2}$
 If $MSE(T_{1})<MSE(T_{2})$ for any parameter $\theta$, then $T_{1}$ is a more efficient estimator
	This value is better because it takes into account the bias, and the variance.
