The **Mean** is one way to measure the average of a set of numbers

---

# Calculation
The **Mean** is calculated by adding up all values from a [Set](../../Mathematics/MAT223%20Notes/Set.md) of numbers, and dividing by the amount of values in the set.

# Sample Mean
Sample mean is defined with the symbol $\overline x$

The mean from a sample [Data Set](Data%20Set.md) with $n$ samples can be calculated by $$\overline x_{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}$$
