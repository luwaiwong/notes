The [Empirical](Empirical.md) **Cumulative Distribution Function (eCDF)** of a set of observed data, determines the proportion of observed data values that are less than equal to a data value $xD$

It is denoted $F_{n}$, and is defined as $F_{n}(x)=\frac{\text{number of elements in dataset}\leq x}{n}$

The **eCDF** provides an estimate of the unknown CDF under which the data values were generated
