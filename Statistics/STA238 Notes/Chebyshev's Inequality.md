**Chebyshev's Inequality** describes the relationship between the [[Probability]] that a [[Random Variable]] will be outside of a certain range of its [[Expected Value]] and its [[Variance]]

---
# Calculation
Chebyshev's Inequality: 
For a [[Random Variable]] $Y$ and $a>0$, $$P(|Y-E[Y]\geq a)\leq \frac{1}{a^{2}}Var(Y)$$

# Theorems & Proofs
Chebyshev's Inequality can be used to prove the [[Law of Large Numbers]]
