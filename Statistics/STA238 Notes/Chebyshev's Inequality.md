**Chebyshev's Inequality** describes the relationship between the [Probability](../STA237%20Notes/Probability.md) that a [Random Variable](Random%20Variable.md) will be outside of a certain range of its [Expected Value](../STA237%20Notes/Expected%20Value.md) and its [Variance](../STA237%20Notes/Variance.md)

# Calculation
Chebyshev's Inequality:  
For a [Random Variable](Random%20Variable.md) $Y$ and $a>0$, $$P(|Y-E[Y]\geq a)\leq \frac{1}{a^{2}}Var(Y)$$

# Theorems & Proofs
Chebyshev's Inequality can be used to prove the [Law of Large Numbers](Law%20of%20Large%20Numbers.md)
