A **Histogram** is a type of graph helpful for evaluating the probability of different events.

Given a [Data Set](Data%20Set.md) of a range of different events, and their frequencies, we can plot a **histogram** of the frequency each data point.

To construct a Histogram:
- Choose bin width $b$
- Divide the range of data into intervals/bins
- For each bin $B_{i}$ compute the proportion of data values in $B_{i}$
- Each bin's height is the proportion divided by $b$, or the density
