A **Sample Statistic** is any [[Function]] of a [[Random Sample]]

It states a fact, or statistic, about the random sample. Generally, it is a function that takes in observations of a [[Random Sample]] and returns a value.

**Sample Statistics** are similar to [[Estimator|Estimators]], in which they are functions which take in observations, and return a value.
The key difference is in the purpose between the two.
	Sample Statistics are an objective measure of a feature of the observations
	While [[Estimator|Estimators]] are  generally attempting to estimate the underlying features of the data

> Sample Statistics are also [[Random Variable|Random Variables]]. 
> This is because the value of the sample statistic is unknown, and will vary based on the values of the [[Random Sample]]
> 	There is a [[Probability Distribution]] for the value of the sample statistic, depending on how the [[Random Sample]] varies
