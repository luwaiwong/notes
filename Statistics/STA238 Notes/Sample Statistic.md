A **Sample Statistic** is any [Function](../../Mathematics/MAT235%20Notes/Function.md) of a [Random Sample](Random%20Sample.md)

It states a fact, or statistic, about the random sample. Generally, it is a function that takes in observations of a [Random Sample](Random%20Sample.md) and returns a value.

**Sample Statistics** are similar to [Estimators](Estimator.md), in which they are functions which take in observations, and return a value.
The key difference is in the purpose between the two.
	Sample Statistics are an objective measure of a feature of the observations
	While [Estimators](Estimator.md) are  generally attempting to estimate the underlying features of the data

> Sample Statistics are also [Random Variables](Random%20Variable.md). 
> This is because the value of the sample statistic is unknown, and will vary based on the values of the [Random Sample](Random%20Sample.md)
> 	There is a [Probability Distribution](Probability%20Distribution.md) for the value of the sample statistic, depending on how the [Random Sample](Random%20Sample.md) varies
