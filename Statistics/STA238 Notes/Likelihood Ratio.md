The **Likelihood Ratio** is a test in order determine how likely a [[Probability Distribution]] is for a given [[Data Set]]

> Generally, we are using the **Likelihood Ratio Test** to determine how likely it is for our [[Null Hypothesis]] to be accurate

---

## Definition

Given a [[Random Sample]] $X=(X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n})$

The [[Likelihood Ratio]] is defined as $\Lambda=\frac{L(\theta_{0}|X)}{L(\hat \theta_{MLE}|X)}$
	$\theta_{0}$ is the distribution that we are determining the likelihood of, and $\hat \theta_{MLE}$ is the [[Maximum Likelihood Estimator]] of the distribution, typically the [[Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function]] we determine from the data
	$L(\theta_{0}|X)$ is the [[Likelihood Function|Likelihood]] of obtaining $\theta_{0}$ for the random sample, with our Null Hypothesis assumptions of the data 
	And  $L(\hat \theta_{MLE}|X)$ is the likelihood of our data, using the [[Maximum Likelihood Estimator]] Distribution generated by the our data

After we calculate a value using the *Likelihood Ratio Test*, we can transform it to a [[Chi^2 Distribution]] using $-2log(\Lambda(\theta_{0}))\approx \chi^{2}(p-1)$, to approximate what the probability of observing that value is
	We always do a "right tail test" when calculating the probability

>		 $\hat \theta_{i}$ is the constructed [[Maximum Likelihood Estimator]] based on the real observed frequencies of the dice
>		 $\theta_{i}|H_{0}$ is the distribution/probability that we would expect if the dice was fair
>	Notice how we calculate $L(\theta_{0}|x)$ and $L(\hat \theta|x)$ 
>		$L(\theta_{0}|x)$ is the probability of observing the frequencies, with the probability that we would expect if the dice was fair
>		$L(\hat \theta|x)$ is the probability of observing the frequencies, with the [[Maximum Likelihood Estimator]]
>			The probability of the **MLE** is based on the frequencies that we observed, and is used to calculate the "real" probability of observing frequencies

### Properties
- The larger $\Lambda(\theta_{0})$ is (Also sometimes denoted as $Lambda(\theta_{0}$), the more likely the null hypothesis is true
- $\Lambda(\theta_{0})\in [0,1]$
- $\Lambda(\theta_{0})$ is a [[Sample Statistic]]
- $-2log(\Lambda(\theta_{0}))\approx \chi^{2}(p-1)$ where $p$ is the dimension of $\theta$
