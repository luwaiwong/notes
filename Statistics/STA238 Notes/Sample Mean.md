**Sample Mean** is an [Function](../../Mathematics/MAT235%20Notes/Function.md) to calculate the [Mean](Mean.md) of a [Random Sample](Random%20Sample.md) or [Data Set](Data%20Set.md)


The formula for **Sample Mean** is $\overline{X}_{n}=\frac{X_{1}+X_{2}+...+X_{n}}{n}$  
	Given a random variable $X$, with a mean of $\mu$, a variance of $\sigma^{2}$, and with $n$ observations  
	The [Expected Value](../STA237%20Notes/Expected%20Value.md) of the sample mean is $E(\overline X_{n})=\mu$  
	The [Variance](../STA237%20Notes/Variance.md) of the sample mean is $Var(\overline X_{n})=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}$
