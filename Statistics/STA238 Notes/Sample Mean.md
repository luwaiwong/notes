**Sample Mean** is an [[Function]] to calculate the [[Mean]] of a [[Random Sample]] or [[Data Set]]


The formula for **Sample Mean** is $\overline{X}_{n}=\frac{X_{1}+X_{2}+...+X_{n}}{n}$
	Given a random variable $X$, with a mean of $\mu$, a variance of $\sigma^{2}$, and with $n$ observations
	The [[Expected Value]] of the sample mean is $E(\overline X_{n})=\mu$
	The [[Variance]] of the sample mean is $Var(\overline X_{n})=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}$
