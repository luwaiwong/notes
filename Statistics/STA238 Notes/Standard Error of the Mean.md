The **Standard Error of the Mean** refers to the [Standard Deviation](../STA237%20Notes/Standard%20Deviation.md) of a set of [means](Mean.md) from a set of experiments

---

# Value
The mean $\overline{y}$, is the average value of an experiment

If we take many different samples of a population and do the experiment to achieve a set of the means from population, this is another sample set of data.  
Here, $\overline{y}$ refers to a random value of the mean, taken from our set

The standard deviation of $\overline{y}, \sigma_{\overline{y}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$  
	This is called the [Standard Error of the Mean](.md)
