The  **Maximum Likelihood Principle** is a general principle that we can use to construct estimators

It says that given a dataset, choose the parameter(s) of interest in such a way that the data is most likely

We use the **Maximum Likelihood Principle** to create a [[Maximum Likelihood Estimator]] and [[Maximum Likelihood Estimate]]
