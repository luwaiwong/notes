The  **Maximum Likelihood Principle** is a general principle that we can use to construct estimators

It says that given a dataset, choose the parameter(s) of interest in such a way that the data is most likely

We use the **Maximum Likelihood Principle** to create a [Maximum Likelihood Estimator](Maximum%20Likelihood%20Estimator.md) and [Maximum Likelihood Estimate](Maximum%20Likelihood%20Estimate.md)
