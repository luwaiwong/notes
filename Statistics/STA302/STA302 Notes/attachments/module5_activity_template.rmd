# Introduction

Measurements (cm) of the sepal length, sepal width along with the petal length and width for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris (setosa, versicolor, virginica).

{MODEL HERE}

We fit the iris data with a linear regression model using R:

```{r}
data(iris)
fit = lm({ENTER YOUR MODEL HERE}, 
        data = iris)
summary(fit)
```
