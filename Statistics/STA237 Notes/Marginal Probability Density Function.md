The **Marginal Probability Density [[Function]]** of a [[Joint Probability Density Function]] describes the probability of only one of the variables occurring

---

# Definition
Let $f$ be the [[Joint Probability Mass Function]] for [[Continuous Random Variable]]s of $X$ and $Y$. The **Marginal Probability Densities** of $X$ and $Y$ are: $$f_{X}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x,y)dy \ \text{ and } \ f_{Y}(y)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x,y)dx$$
