A **Quantile** describes what percentage of a population is lower than a value of a [[Continuous Random Variable]]

---
# Definition
Let $p$ be a number between 0 and 1, the *p*th **quantile** or 100*p*th **percentile** of the [[Probability Distribution|distribution]] of a [[Continuous Random Variable]] Y is the smallest number $q_{p}$ such that $$F(q_{p})=P(Y \leq q_{p})=p$$
Or, the the value of the [[Cumulative Distribution Function]] for $q_{p}$ is $p$
The **median** of a distribution is its **50th percentile or quantile**
