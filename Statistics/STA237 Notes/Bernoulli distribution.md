The **Bernoulli distribution** is used to model experiments with only two possible outcomes. It is essentially the [[Binomial Distribution]] conducted one time.

A [[Discrete Random Variable]] *X* has a **Bernoulli distribution** when, with a [[Probability]] probability p, where $0 \leq p \leq 1$, if its [[Probability Mass Function]]can be given by p$$p_{X}(1)=P(X=1)=p  \ \text{  and  } \  p_{X}(0)=P(X=0)=1-p$$ This distribution is denoted $Ber(p)$.

# Definition

A [[Discrete Random Variable]] *X* has a **Bernoulli distribution** when, with a [[Probability]] probability p, where $0 \leq p \leq 1$, if its [[Probability Mass Function]] can be given by p$$p_{X}(1)=P(X=1)=p  \ \text{  and  } \  p_{X}(0)=P(X=0)=1-p$$ This distribution is denoted $Ber(p)$.


$p_{X}$ is denoted as such instead of $p$ for the probability mass function of *X* to emphasize its dependence on *X* and to avoid confusion with the parameter *p* in the Bernoulli distribution 

# Other 
Given $p$ probability of success,
[[Expected Value]]: $$E(X) = p$$
[[Variance]]:$$Var(X)=p(1-p)$$
