The **Bernoulli distribution** is used to model experiments with only two possible outcomes. It is essentially the [Binomial Distribution](Binomial%20Distribution.md) conducted one time.

A [Discrete Random Variable](Discrete%20Random%20Variable.md) *X* has a **Bernoulli distribution** when, with a [Probability](Probability.md) probability p, where $0 \leq p \leq 1$, if its [Probability Mass Function](Probability%20Mass%20Function.md)can be given by p$$p_{X}(1)=P(X=1)=p  \ \text{  and  } \  p_{X}(0)=P(X=0)=1-p$$ This distribution is denoted $Ber(p)$.

# Definition

A [Discrete Random Variable](Discrete%20Random%20Variable.md) *X* has a **Bernoulli distribution** when, with a [Probability](Probability.md) probability p, where $0 \leq p \leq 1$, if its [Probability Mass Function](Probability%20Mass%20Function.md) can be given by p$$p_{X}(1)=P(X=1)=p  \ \text{  and  } \  p_{X}(0)=P(X=0)=1-p$$ This distribution is denoted $Ber(p)$.


$p_{X}$ is denoted as such instead of $p$ for the probability mass function of *X* to emphasize its dependence on *X* and to avoid confusion with the parameter *p* in the Bernoulli distribution 

# Other 
Given $p$ probability of success,  
[Expected Value](Expected%20Value.md): $$E(X) = p$$  
[Variance](Variance.md):$$Var(X)=p(1-p)$$
