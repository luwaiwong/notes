The **Conditional Probability** of $A$ given $B$ is the [[Probability]] that $A$ will happen if $B$ happens

---

# Notation
Conditional probability between two events, A **given** C would be written as
$$P(A|C) \ = \ ?$$

# Definition
## Given probabilities
The **Conditional Probability** of **A given C** given A and C is 
$$P(A|C) \ = \ \frac{P(A\cap C)}{P(C)}$$
**given *P(C)* > 0** 

## Joint Probabilities
Given the [[Joint Probability Mass Function]], 
The Conditional Probability of $Y$ given $X$, or $X$ given $Y$ is: $$P_{Y|X}(y|x)=\frac{P_{X,Y}(x,y)}{P_{x}(x)} \ \text{ and } \ P_{X|Y}(x|y)=\frac{P_{X,Y}(x,y)}{P_{Y}(y)}$$
# Properties
If the conditional probability is the same as the regular probability, the two events are *independent*
