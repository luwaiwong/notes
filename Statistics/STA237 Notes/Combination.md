The **Combination** of a [Set](Set.md) is the number of ways $r$ unordered elements can be organized from a set of $n$ distinct elements

Can be thought of as the *number of ways to select $r$ objects from $n$ objects*, and can be called *"n Choose r"*

# Calculations
### Without Replacement
The number of ways to select $r$ objects from $n$ objects is $$_nC_{r}=\begin{pmatrix} n \\ r\end{pmatrix} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$
### With Replacement
With replacement, the number of ways to select $r$ objects from $n$ objects is  
$$\begin{pmatrix} r+n-1 \\ r\end{pmatrix}$$
