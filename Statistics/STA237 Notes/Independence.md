Two [Random Variable](../STA238%20Notes/Random%20Variable.md)s $X$ and $Y$ are **Independent** if the probability of one does not influence the other

---
# Definition
Given two [Event](Event.md)s, *A* and *B*, they are **independent** if one of the following is satisfied
- *$P(A|B) = P(A)$
- $P(B|A) = P(B)$
- $P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$ 

[Random Variable](../STA238%20Notes/Random%20Variable.md)s $X$ and $Y$ are *Independent* if $$P(X\leq a,Y\leq b)=P(X\leq a)P(Y\leq b)$$or, $$F(a,b)=F_{X}(a)F_{Y}(b)$$For all possible values $a$ and $b$ 

# Mutually Exclusive
Independent is different from being [Mutually Exclusive(Disjoint)](Mutually%20Exclusive(Disjoint)), independent events can happen at the same times, but have the same chance of occurring regardless
