The **Joint Cumulative Distribution Function** is like the [[Cumulative Distribution Function]], it describes the [[Probability]] that an event <= the input occurs

---
# Definition
The **Joint Distribution Function** $F$ of two [[Random Variable]]s $X$ and $Y$ is the [[Function]] $F:\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow[0,1]$ defined by $$F(a,b)= P(X\leq a, Y\leq b) \ \text{ for } \ -\infty$$
## Discrete Random Variables
The **Joint CDF** of [[Discrete Random Variable]]s $X$ and $Y$ is: $$P_{X,Y}(x,y)=P(X\leq x,Y\leq y)$$

## Continuous Random Variables
With [[Continuous Random Variable]], we are looking for the **volume under the graph** of the [[Joint Probability Density Function]]
