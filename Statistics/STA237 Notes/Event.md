[Statistics](Statistics.md)

Events are subsets of a [Sample Space](Sample%20Space.md) (Events are sets). An event *occurs* if the outcome of the experiment is an element of the Event.

Two events are *disjoint* or *mutually exclusive* if both events have no outcomes in common.
$A \cap B = \emptyset$  

An event A *implies* event B if all the outcomes of A are all in B, $A \in B$ 

All events have a [Probability](Probability.md) of occurring from 0-1

If the probability of two events are unrelated, then they have [Independence](Independence.md)/are Independent
