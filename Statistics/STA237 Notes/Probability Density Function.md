The **Probability Density Function** describes the [[Probability]] of every value in a [[Continuous Random Variable]]

---
# Probability Density
Let $Y$ denote a [[Continuous Random Variable]], Let $F(y)$ denote its [[Cumulative Distribution Function]]. The **Probability Density Function** can be defined as $$f(y)=\frac{dF(y)}{dy}=F'(y)$$
Wherever this derivative exists, it is called the **probability density function** for $Y$

## Properties
- $f(y) \geq 0  \ \ \forall y, -\infty < y < \infty$
- $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(y)dy=1$
