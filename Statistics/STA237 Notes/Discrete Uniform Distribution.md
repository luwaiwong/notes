A **Discrete Uniform Distribution** describes a random experiment with equally likely outcomes 

---
# Definition
X is called a **Discrete Uniform** [[Discrete Random Variable]] if it has the [[Probability Mass Function]]: $$p_{x}(x)=\frac{1}{n}, x=a,a+1,...,b$$ for integers $a,b$ with $b \geq a$ and $n=b-a+1$

# Related Functions
Given 

[[Expected Value]]: $$E(X)=\frac{a+b}{2}$$
[[Variance]]: $$Var(X)=\frac{n^{2}-1}{12}$$
[[Moment Generating Function]]: $$M_{x}(t)=e^{\lambda (e^{t}-1)}$$
