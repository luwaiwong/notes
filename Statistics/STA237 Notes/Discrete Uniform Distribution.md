A **Discrete Uniform Distribution** describes a random experiment with equally likely outcomes 

---
# Definition
X is called a **Discrete Uniform** [Discrete Random Variable](Discrete%20Random%20Variable.md) if it has the [Probability Mass Function](Probability%20Mass%20Function.md): $$p_{x}(x)=\frac{1}{n}, x=a,a+1,...,b$$ for integers $a,b$ with $b \geq a$ and $n=b-a+1$

# Related Functions
Given 

[Expected Value](Expected%20Value.md): $$E(X)=\frac{a+b}{2}$$  
[Variance](Variance.md): $$Var(X)=\frac{n^{2}-1}{12}$$  
[Moment Generating Function](Moment%20Generating%20Function.md): $$M_{x}(t)=e^{\lambda (e^{t}-1)}$$
