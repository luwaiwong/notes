A **Continuous Random Variable** is a [[Discrete Random Variable|Random Variable]] that can take on any value in an interval.

---
# Distribution and Density Function
**Continuous Random Variables** have a [[Cumulative Distribution Function|Probability Distribution Function]] same as a [[Discrete Random Variable]] which describes the probability of a value less than or equal than a value occurring

The [[Probability Mass Function|Probability Density Function]] of a **Continuous Random Variable** describes the probability of a value occurring, and can be derived by its [[Cumulative Distribution Function]]

For a continuous random variable, you **cannot find P(X=?)** because the area under a graph for one singular point is nothing
# Expected Value
The [[Expected Value]] of a **continuous random variable** $Y$ is defined as $$\mu=E(Y)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}yf(y)dy$$provided the integral exists
