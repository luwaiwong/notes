A **Continuous Random Variable** is a [Random Variable](Discrete%20Random%20Variable.md) that can take on any value in an interval.

---
# Distribution and Density Function
**Continuous Random Variables** have a [Probability Distribution Function](Cumulative%20Distribution%20Function.md) same as a [Discrete Random Variable](Discrete%20Random%20Variable.md) which describes the probability of a value less than or equal than a value occurring

The [Probability Density Function](Probability%20Mass%20Function.md) of a **Continuous Random Variable** describes the probability of a value occurring, and can be derived by its [Cumulative Distribution Function](Cumulative%20Distribution%20Function.md)

For a continuous random variable, you **cannot find P(X=?)** because the area under a graph for one singular point is nothing
# Expected Value
The [Expected Value](Expected%20Value.md) of a **continuous random variable** $Y$ is defined as $$\mu=E(Y)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}yf(y)dy$$provided the integral exists
