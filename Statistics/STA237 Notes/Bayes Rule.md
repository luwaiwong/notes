Suppose the events $C_{1},C_{2},...,C_{m}$ are disjoint, and $C_{1}\cup C_{2}\cup ... \cup C_{m} =\Omega$. The conditional probability of $C_{i}$, given an arbitrary event *A*, can be expressed as: $$P(C_{i}|A) = \frac{P(A|C_{i})\cdot P(C_{i})}{P(A|C_{1})P(C_{1})+P(A|C_{2})P(C_{2})+...+P(A|C_{m})P(C_{m})}$$  
Or also  
If *P(A) > 0* and *P(C) > 0* then  
$$P(C|A) = \frac{P(A|C)P(C)}{P(A)}$$

Works because it is a rewriting of [Conditional Probability](Conditional%20Probability.md)  
$$P(A|C) \ = \ \frac{P(A\cap C)}{P(C)}$$  
$$P(A|C)P(C) \ = P(A\cap C)$$$$\frac{P(A|C)P(C)}{P(A)} \ = \frac{P(A\cap C)}{P(A)}$$By conditional probability, $$P(C|A) = \frac{P(A|C)P(C)}{P(A)}$$  
Is also a rewriting of the [Multiplication Rule](Multiplication%20Rule.md)

P(B) = prior probability (probability of B under no conditions)  
P(B|A) = posterior probability (probability of B quantified after observed under conditions)

The top formula is essentially the second formula, with The [Law of total probability](Law%20of%20total%20probability.md) substituted into the bottom section of the equation
