**Non-Sampling Error** when collecting data is error from sample, but not due to the variability between sample and population
- Arise due to issues like improper data collection methods, mismeasurement, respondent bias, data processing mistakes
- Often systematic (bias results in one direction)
- Can be minimized with careful survey design
- More difficult to correct than sampling bias
