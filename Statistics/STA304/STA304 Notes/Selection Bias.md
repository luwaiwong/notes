 **Selection Bias** is when individuals in a study/analysis are not representative of the target population  
Possible Causes
- Non-Random Sampling: Choosing participants based on certain characteristics
- Loss to follow up: In long studies, if certain groups drop out of the study at higher rates than other, may lead to bias
- Exclusion of certain groups
