## Types of Populations
### Target population
- The entire group that a researcher intends to study
- The broader group that we want our findings to apply to

### Frame Population
- The list from which our [[Sample]] is actually drawn from
- Is a practical representation of the target population
- May not fully capture everyone in target, due to limitations in access or records

### Sample Population

- The actual group which we collect data from
